## 0. Role of this index and documentary governance contract

As of `G28-DOCS-B1` (additive phase, no migration), this file
is formally recognized as the project's **sole arbiter of
documentary authority and canonical paths**. It answers:

- what is the **order of authority** among documents;
- what is the **classification** of each document (canonical,
  operational, contract, runbook, legacy, diagnostic,
  governance);
- what are the **canonical paths**;
- which documents are **legacy** and pending reconciliation;
- what is the **responsibility** of each document category.

This index is **not** the source of the current phase, next
action, HEAD, working tree, operational status, or closeout
history. Those facts belong to `PROJECT_STATE.md`, Git, and the
front ledger, per the contract in
[`docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md`](governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md).

The **documentary governance model** that governs ownership,
duplication, per-phase updates, minimum documentary transaction,
compaction, and treatment of Git/migrations/HEAD is
`docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md`. In case of conflict
between any project document and this model, the model prevails,
unless the revision is recorded in this index and in the
respective ledger.

The competing lists of "canonical sources (fontes canônicas)",
"functional precedence", and "required documents" that existed
in other files (§2 of this index,
`docs/architecture/CLAUDE_PROJECT_ASSET_MAP.md`,
`Guide-and-governance-rules.stxt`) were reconciled in
`G28-DOCS-B3-E1`: they now point to §1 of this index as the
sole active list of authority. No other competing list should
be created.

## 1. Canonical documentary authority (single list)

This is the **sole active list of documentary authority** in
the project. Any other document describing authority,
prevalence, precedence, or "required documents" must point to
this section, not repeat the list.

| Document | Role |
|---|---|
| `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` (this file) | Classifies the documents and defines their roles. |
| `docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md` | Defines the governance model and the rules for per-phase documentary updates. Content in English since `DOC-LANGUAGE-MIGRATION-L1`; pt-BR original archived at `docs/archive/pt-BR/` (see §7). |
| `docs/governance/SUPERVISION_PROTOCOL.md` | Defines the roles of the supervision process (Architect/Reviewer/Resident Executor), onboarding of a new reviewer, order format, and gates (visual validation, approved mockup, migration as its own gate, Auth risk kept separate). Does not define state or documentary organization rules — that is `DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md`. Content in English since `DOC-LANGUAGE-MIGRATION-L1`; pt-BR original archived at `docs/archive/pt-BR/` (see §7). |
| `docs/governance/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Single tracked repository-agent behavior source for Claude Code, Codex, and equivalent repository-capable agents. It defines bootstrap, evidence, safety, and proportional-update behavior but owns no current state or product semantics. |
| `PROJECT_STATE.md` (root) | **Current-state authority** — sole owner of the current operational state per front. Compacted to a current-state hub by `GOVERNANCE-STATE-HANDOFF-COMPACTION-R1` (2026-07-20); historical narratives live in the ledger and closeout archives. Content in English since `DOC-LANGUAGE-MIGRATION-L2`; pt-BR original archived at `docs/archive/pt-BR/PROJECT_STATE.md` (see §7). |
| `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` (root) | **Derived current operational handoff** — sole active handoff, derived from `PROJECT_STATE.md`; never a second state owner. Reduced to a concise derived handoff by `GOVERNANCE-STATE-HANDOFF-COMPACTION-R1` (2026-07-20); the prior stack is preserved in `docs/closeouts/AGENT_HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md`. Content in English since `DOC-LANGUAGE-MIGRATION-L2`; pt-BR original archived at `docs/archive/pt-BR/AGENT_HANDOFF.md` (see §7). |
| `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` | Structured append-only history of the G28 front. |
| `docs/refactor/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_LEDGER.md` | History exclusive to the refactor front. |
| `docs/legacy/pre-model/MANIFEST.md` | Immutable pre-model preservation; not operational. |
| Git | Commits, diffs, manifests, branch, HEAD, staging, and divergence — consult directly. |

> These roles **do not overlap**. In divergence between
> documents with distinct roles, the document whose role
> matches the question resolves it (state → `PROJECT_STATE.md`;
> update rule → `DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md`; authority/classification
> → this index; commit/diff → Git). The detailed per-phase update
> matrix is in
> [`docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md`](governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md) §11.

### Classificatory inventory (documents by category)

The documents below have a legitimate classificatory or
contractual function; they are **not** a second prevalence
list. In divergence with §1, resolve by the role of each one.

| Document | Category | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/architecture/CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md` | Architectural contract | 19 binding architectural health rules (18 modularization + rule 19, on language). Every new phase must comply. Content in English since `DOC-LANGUAGE-MIGRATION-L1`; pt-BR original archived at `docs/archive/pt-BR/` (see §7). |
| `docs/architecture/PORTAL_B2B_ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md` | Architectural contract | Rules for the Portal B2B/Pedidos front: separates client/admin/supplier, operational vs. visual status, common components, phase decomposition. |
| `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_MOVIMENTACAO_DOCUMENTOS_PLANO.md` | Persistent plan | Plan for the Pedido ↔ OP ↔ Movimentação ↔ Documentos front: entry state, decisions, target model, screen roles, future phases (B through J), evidence template. |
| `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_SCHEMA_CONTRACT.md` | Technical contract | Schema contract for Pedido ↔ OP ↔ Movimentação ↔ Documentos. §13 is the accepted exact structural realization of the F1 executable contract. §13.15 remains the unchanged C3B executable contract; §13.16 records C3C-A local technical acceptance; §13.17 adds governance metadata for `OC-C3D-ACL-001`; §13.18 (applied 2026-07-20) records the legacy-compat receipt-adapter schema (additive `idempotency_namespace` `CHECK` only) for `PHASE-C3C-B-DB-PREREQ`. Current routing is owned by `PROJECT_STATE.md`; C3C-B application implementation remains unauthorized. |
| `docs/architecture/ORDEM_COMPRA_LIFECYCLE_SPEC_PROPOSED.md` | Ratified architectural contract | Governing four-layer purchase-order model. §R.29 core remains the unchanged accepted Phase-C3 product contract; §R.30 records C3C-A local technical acceptance; §R.31 adds stable active-continuation requirement labels; §R.29.7 (applied 2026-07-20) records the legacy-compat database prerequisites for `PHASE-C3C-B-DB-PREREQ`. Current routing is owned by `PROJECT_STATE.md`; C3C-B application implementation remains unauthorized. |
| `docs/architecture/ORDEM_COMPRA_C3_TRACEABILITY.md` | Derived active-track traceability | Maps the active Phase-C continuation requirement IDs to existing lifecycle/schema anchors, owning phase, disposition, implementation, evidence, environment, checkpoint, and residual debt. It creates no architecture or authorization. |
| `docs/architecture/ORDEM_COMPRA_C3C_B_PHASE_CONTRACT.md` | Material phase contract (closed / accepted_with_nonblocking_debt / locally verified; not active) | Binds `OC-C3-READ-001`/`OC-C3-WRITE-001`/`OC-C3-COMPAT-001`/`OC-C3-NOUI-001` to an exact repository scope, dependency inventory, implementation-file manifest, tests, evidence, and hard stops for the `PHASE-C3C-B` application compatibility/adaptation implementation. Created by `C3C-B-MATERIAL-PHASE-CONTRACT-R1` (docs-only); forward-corrected and accepted `ACCEPTED_WITH_BLOCKING_DATABASE_PREREQUISITES` (§31); activated by §32 once the companion database-prerequisites contract's environment application was supervisor-accepted; implemented in §33, corrected in §34/§35, and supervisor-accepted in §36 (`STATUS: CLOSED / ACCEPTED_WITH_NONBLOCKING_DEBT / LOCALLY VERIFIED`, checkpoint `22bfb192c6c2ad10ccd2b2883d54c3a17e40cc9f`, 2026-07-21). No dependent `OC-C3-*` requirement is `SATISFIED`. `PROJECT_STATE.md` remains sole owner of `ACTIVE_PHASE`/`ACTIVE_PHASE_CONTRACT` (both `NONE`). |
| `docs/architecture/ORDEM_COMPRA_C3C_B_DB_PREREQUISITES_PHASE_CONTRACT.md` | Material phase contract (closed / technically accepted / local DB verified / not applied to staging database; not active) | Defines two database components (canonical order-catalog projection; atomic legacy receipt-intent adapter) that close the two hard stops recorded in `ORDEM_COMPRA_C3C_B_PHASE_CONTRACT.md` §25/§26. R2 architecture accepted in §34; `PHASE-C3C-B-DB-PREREQ` **implemented** in §35, **DB-backed-validated** in §36, and **supervisor-accepted** in §37 (`STATUS: CLOSED / TECHNICALLY ACCEPTED / LOCAL DB VERIFIED / NOT APPLIED TO STAGING DATABASE`) — `db/76` (Component A + Component B, both inert-until-`canonical_active`; two functions + one additive `idempotency_namespace` `CHECK`, no bridge/backfill/`db/67`/`db/75` change), the three contracted tests (the two DB-backed ones executed and passing against an isolated disposable local PostgreSQL 18.4 cluster, including a persisted rollback rehearsal and reapply), and the applied `§R.29.7`/`§13.18` deltas. §35 records the architect ruling that legacy-compat receipts reuse the native command types and carry compat identity in `idempotency_namespace='legacy_compat_receipt_v1'` (no `recebimento_compat`; shape guard unchanged); §36 records one genuine `db/76` defect found and fixed (a PL/pgSQL naming ambiguity in Component A) and that the C3C-A DB-backed regressions remain unexecutable against any synthetic corpus (pre-existing, unrelated limitation, recorded as nonblocking C3C-A fixture debt); §37 records supervisor acceptance — `db/76` is **not applied to any staging database**, and no dependent `OC-C3-*` requirement is marked `SATISFIED`. §38 records the applied-to-development-database (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`) closeout, inert; §39 records supervisor acceptance of that environment application, which activated `ORDEM_COMPRA_C3C_B_PHASE_CONTRACT.md` §32 and its `PHASE-C3C-B` implementation. Fixed corpus binding; completeness/freeze/re-baseline deferred to real-cutover/C3D. `PROJECT_STATE.md` remains sole owner of `ACTIVE_PHASE`/`ACTIVE_PHASE_CONTRACT` (both `NONE`). |
| `docs/architecture/ORDEM_COMPRA_C3D_PHASE_CONTRACT.md` | Material phase contract (accepted; `PHASE-C3D-A` + `PHASE-C3D-B` closed / technically accepted / locally verified; `PHASE-C3D-C` implemented / locally verified / awaiting supervisor acceptance; active) | Binds the four already-ratified `OC-C3D-*` requirements (`OC-C3D-DEPLOY-001`/`OC-C3D-FENCE-001`/`OC-C3D-ACL-001`/`OC-C3D-LOCK-001`) to an isolated-rehearsal scope for `PHASE-C3D` (inactive deployment & rehearsal): six sublots (C3D-A…C3D-F), environment strategy (disposable local PostgreSQL + read-only shared-DB inspection, §D Option 2), entry/exit gates, test matrix, recovery/PONR model, exact future manifests, and mandatory supervisor decisions. Creates no requirement and changes no anchor; every `OC-C3D-*` disposition remains as ratified. Authored by `docs: accept C3C-B and define C3D contract` (2026-07-21), forward-corrected twice the same day (`docs: correct C3D contract boundaries` §0/R1; `docs: finalize C3D contract execution boundaries` §0b/R2), then **accepted** by the supervisor (§0c) under the "PHASE-C3D-A — ENVIRONMENT AND DEPLOYMENT-MANIFEST QUALIFICATION" order, which explicitly authorized `PHASE-C3D-A` alone and recorded its implementation/evidence at §O (`scripts/c3d/bootstrap-disposable-cluster.mjs`, `tests/ordem-compra-c3d-deploy.smoke.js`; no migration applied to any cluster or database; read-only `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo` inspection succeeded). The material-contract `PHASE_ID` was subsequently restored from the documentary-error `PHASE-C3D-A` to `PHASE-C3D` and `PHASE-C3D-A` recorded `CLOSED / TECHNICALLY ACCEPTED / LOCALLY VERIFIED` at checkpoint `096cd603…` (§Q.1); `PHASE-C3D-B` (inactive migration/application-presence validation) added the authorized `tests/ordem-compra-c3d-deploy.integration.sql` (full ordered `db/01`…`db/76` applied to two fresh disposable local clusters; inactive Component A/B, idempotency, zero-mutation, and cluster-destruction proofs) (§Q). The supervisor then **accepted** `PHASE-C3D-A` (`096cd603…`) and `PHASE-C3D-B` (`5441321…`), advanced `OC-C3D-DEPLOY-001` to `SATISFIED`, and corrected the §G item 9 pre-PONR rollback semantics (restores `flat` reads only, stays `maintenance_fenced`, does not return to `legacy_active`) (§R). `PHASE-C3D-C` was then `AUTHORIZED / NOT STARTED` (fresh Claude session required) (§R.3). `PHASE-C3D-C` (fence and pre-PONR rollback rehearsal) subsequently added the authorized `tests/ordem-compra-c3d-fence.integration.sql` (database-faithful authenticated actor-context fence-denial proof, 8-table×3-op structural fence matrix, pre-PONR rollback rehearsal, across two fresh disposable local clusters) and is `IMPLEMENTED / LOCALLY VERIFIED / AWAITING SUPERVISOR ACCEPTANCE` (§S) — not self-accepted. `PHASE-C3D-D` through `C3D-F` remain separately unauthorized. `PROJECT_STATE.md` remains sole owner of `ACTIVE_PHASE`/`ACTIVE_PHASE_CONTRACT` (`PHASE-C3D` / this file's path). |
| `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_PRODUCTION_FLOW_BACKLOG.md` | Backlog | Backlog of the Pedido production flow (§1-8) + Admin backlog (§9). 8 production items (A-H) + 10 Admin items (P1/P2). Mandatory reading before implementation in the production flow. |
| `docs/architecture/AUTH_DELETE_USER_DESIGN.md` | Design | Semantics of user deletion/deactivation: deactivate (soft delete + Auth ban) instead of physically deleting. |
| `docs/architecture/CAMADA2_USUARIOS_SPEC_PROPOSED.md` | Spec (design, historical) | Spec for Camada 2 (user administration, A1-A7 + password policy): evidenced comparison Tapetes × SGAA_clean_baseline (external functional/visual reference, read-only), module plan, Auth risk classification, and order of subphases with gates. **Status: `DELIVERED` — every subphase named (`A1`-`A7`) was subsequently authorized in its own order and is `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`** (`G28-CAMADA-2` track `COMPLETE`, closed at the `A3.4` closeout, 2026-07-17). Retained as the historical spec/rationale; current operational state lives in `PROJECT_STATE.md`. |
| `docs/architecture/CAMADA3_BACKUP_CONTRACT.md` | Contract (design, proposed) | Backup contract for Camada 3 (automated backup, `BK1`-`BK8`): evidenced diagnosis of the live schema/Storage/extensions state, SGAA_clean_baseline comparison (external functional/UX reference only, engine/scheduler rejected as stack-specific), scope (`public` + full `auth` schema; document bytes and Storage explicitly out of scope), cadence/retention (GFS), integrity (SHA-256 + row-count manifest), N-destination contract (Drive primary, OneDrive interface-ready), trigger-agnostic exporter contract, and the restore-drill contract. **Status: `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` as the ratified `PROPOSED` premise for all later `G28-CAMADA-3` subphases** (`BK3`, 2026-07-17); `BK4.1`-`BK8` and `CAMADA3-TRIGGER-SELECTION` each require their own separate authorization. Current operational state lives in `PROJECT_STATE.md`. | `G28-CAMADA-3-DIAGNOSIS-R1` (diagnosis) + `BK3` (contract) |
| `docs/design/CAMADA2_A32_MOCKUP_APPROVED.md` | Design (approved) | Approved visual specification for `A3.2` (summary/KPI cards, toolbar, role badge, inactive-row opacity): final color/spacing/typography values, implemented in `js/screens/admin-usuarios.js`. Explicitly documents what was left out of scope ("Last access" column, blocked by migration HARD STOP; A5 icons; A3.3 bulk actions). **Status: `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`** (architect visual validation confirmed 2026-07-15). |
| `docs/architecture/CLAUDE_PROJECT_ASSET_MAP.md` | Asset inventory | Map of components, entry points, contracts, and `.claude` structure. **Not a source of current state nor an authority arbiter.** |
| `Guide-and-governance-rules.stxt` (root) | Agent governance | Stable operational rules for the Architect/IAexec agent (Git, scope, decomposition, routing). **Does not repeat this authority list.** |

### Operational runbooks (complement, do not replace)

Runbooks describe **how to execute** approved procedures. They
do not replace §1 authority; in divergence, §1 prevails.

| Document | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `docs/operations/AUTH_USER_PROVISIONING_RUNBOOK.md` | Standard operational procedure for creating users (admin/supplier) via Edge Function `admin-create-user` + UI `#/cadastros/usuarios`. Replaces the manual flow of creating an Auth user in Studio and copying the UID. |
| `docs/operations/AUTH_DISABLE_USER_PROD_RELEASE_PLAN.md` | Operational release plan for taking the Auth chain from staging to production. Required order, GO/NO-GO criteria, rollback, read-only validations. |
| `docs/operations/PARALLEL_ENVIRONMENT_RECONCILIATION.md` | Official taxonomy of the environments: `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` = Legacy (do not touch), `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo` = working parallel. State of each environment, architectural decision, next steps. |

## 1b. UI diagnostic documents (non-normative, non-executable)

Documents in this section **compare** approved mockups against
the current implementation, to scope future phases of visual
adjustment. **Not a canonical source**, they do not by
themselves authorize implementation and do not replace the §1
authority list.

| Document | Purpose | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/ui/CLIENTE_PORTAL_UI_GAP_INVENTORY.md` | Read-only inventory of divergences between the 5 mockups of the B2B Client Portal (Dashboard, Novo Pedido, Modal Adicionar Item, Detalhe do Pedido, Acompanhamento) and the current `js/screens/cliente-*.js` screens. Per-screen matrix, detailed gaps, operational particulars still TBD, and proposal of future phases (`UI-GAP-FIX-*`, `UI-OPERATIONS-RULES-A`). Implements or fixes nothing. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CLIENTE-PORTAL-UI-GAP-INVENTORY-A` |
| `docs/ui/CLIENTE_PORTAL_UI_OPERATIONS_RULES.md` | Docs-only operational matrix for the B2B Client Portal UI. Consolidates decisions already closed, records pending items `OP-001` through `OP-012`, technical recommendations, per-screen impact, and the future sequence (`UI-GAP-FIX-NOVO-PEDIDO-A` through `UI-GAP-FIX-SHELL-A`). Does not implement UI nor change code/schema/Supabase. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CLIENTE-PORTAL-UI-OPERATIONS-RULES-A` |

## 1c. Structured history and per-front preservation

Classificatory detail of the history/preservation roles
declared in §1. Not a second authority list.

- `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` — append-only; not a source of current state;
  does not replace Git; does not automatically reconstruct pre-model history.
- `docs/refactor/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_LEDGER.md` — history ledger
  exclusive to the refactor front; stays at its current path; must not be
  copied into `docs/legacy/`.
- `docs/legacy/pre-model/MANIFEST.md` — index of the complete and
  immutable snapshots prior to compaction; snapshots are not sources of
  current state; snapshots receive no new closeouts; content preserved for
  audit, not for operational routing.
- `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` — closeout narratives
  of phases moved from `PROJECT_STATE.md` by `PROJECT-STATE-COMPACTION-A`
  (2026-07-16) and `PROJECT-STATE-COMPACTION-B` (2026-07-17, its own
  batch divider — the 2026-07-17 Camada-2/Camada-3 subphase narratives, the
  superseded Publication Criterion, and the UI-track closeouts), verbatim and
  in original order. **Historical / non-operational — not a source of current
  state** (that is `PROJECT_STATE.md`, now current-state-only); archived
  phases are indexed in the "Accepted-phase index" of `PROJECT_STATE.md`.
  Append-only for this batch; the architect decisions recorded there
  remain in force and are condensed in `PROJECT_STATE.md` §"Binding
  decisions in force".
- `docs/closeouts/AGENT_HANDOFF_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` — the accumulated
  operational-handoff stack moved verbatim from the root `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` by
  `GOVERNANCE-STATE-HANDOFF-COMPACTION-R1` (2026-07-20). **Historical /
  non-operational — carries no live next-action authority.** The current-state
  owner is `PROJECT_STATE.md`; the current operational handoff is the root
  `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`. Append-only for this batch.

## 1d. Diagnostic and reconciliation reports, and external supervision artifacts (non-normative)

Documents in this section record read-only diagnostics or
external supervision artifacts. They are not a canonical source
of state, do not by themselves authorize implementation, and do
not replace the §1 authority list. Architect decisions derived
from these documents are recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.md` and in
the ledger of the applicable front, not in the documents
themselves.

| Document | Purpose | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/reports/BACKLOG_RECONCILIATION_R1_2026-07-15.md` | Read-only diagnostic of the general backlog: inventory in the actual code of Camada 2 (user administration) and Camada 3 (backup), worktree audit, factual evidence of the Documents section validation (without classifying acceptance), a single table of remaining backlog, and divergences between canonical/code/ChatGPT closeout. Does not change state; decisions derived are recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.md` (`G28-RECONCILIATION-DECISIONS-A`). | `BACKLOG-RECONCILIATION-READONLY-R1` |
| `docs/reports/TEST_MOCK_FIDELITY_AUDIT_2026-07-17.md` | Read-only fidelity audit of every test double in `tests/` (124 suites) against the real behavior it imitates (DOM/`el()` boolean coercion, `functions.invoke()` double envelope, `.rpc()`/PostgREST envelopes, `js/ui.js` primitives): per-suite verdicts, the zero-live-(c) result, the structural residual classes (`R1`/`R2`/`R3`), the shared-double `tests/_doubles.js` assessment, prioritized lots (`L0`–`L3`), and the known-debt re-grounding (fixed-port `:8765` + stale inline-`<script>` assertions). Does not change state; decisions derived (shared-double approval, `§20`, lot authorizations) are recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.md` and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md`. | `TEST-MOCK-FIDELITY-AUDIT` |
| `docs/reports/PRODUCTION_READINESS_DIAGNOSIS_R1_2026-07-17.md` | Read-only production-readiness diagnosis for migrating the whole system to a new environment (new repo `inttexsystem/inttracker` + new Supabase `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk` + Vercel `vercel.com/inttex`): migration inventory (authoritative schema path = ordered `db/01`→`db/64` replay, not `setup_completo.sql`/`db push`; auth migrate-vs-recreate; 5 edge functions + 3 secrets; config/ingestor/backup repoint surface; 0 buckets), Vercel + repo-linked Supabase assessment (Vercel cron does NOT resolve `CAMADA3-TRIGGER-SELECTION` — use GitHub Actions; preview-deploy DB-exposure risk), branch recommendation (full-history push of 749 commits preserves ~656 SHA citations; squash rejected), the **canonical residual risk register** (12 items, ranked), the minimum pre-launch set, and the proposed `M0`-`M10` migration plan with gates and rollback. **`ACCEPTED` / ratified reference report (2026-07-17).** Does not change state; decisions derived (amended publication criterion, backlog freeze, active `M0`-`M10` track, canonical residual risk register, 749-commit correction) are recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.md` and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md`. | `PRODUCTION-READINESS-DIAGNOSIS-R1` |
| `docs/handoffs/CHATGPT_CLOSEOUT_2026-07-15.md` | Closeout record of ChatGPT's supervision: state per its own record, orders issued but not closed, decisions discussed outside canonical files, and pending items awaiting architect decision. External, non-canonical artifact; its `PROJECT-CONTROL-BASELINE-R1` report was evaluated and rejected (`REJECTED / NOT RATIFIED`) in `PROJECT_STATE.md` (`G28-RECONCILIATION-DECISIONS-A`). | External handoff (ChatGPT), not numbered as a project phase |
| `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` (root) | Tracked, byte-identical, minimal harness wrappers for Claude Code and Codex. **Authority: NONE** — both point exclusively to `docs/governance/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and contain no current phase, HEAD, backlog, or history. | `GOVERNANCE-SPEC-CUSTODY-FOUNDATION-R1` |
| `scripts/validate-spec-custody.mjs` | Dependency-free local validator for bootstrap paths, active-phase agreement, closed-phase dispositions, checkpoint accounting, wrapper identity/tracking, and unique anchored active requirements. It owns no state or semantics. | `GOVERNANCE-SPEC-CUSTODY-FOUNDATION-R1` |
| `.claude/launch.json` | Harness config to start the local static server (`python -m http.server 8765`) used in the architect's visual validation gates (A3.1 and future Camada 2 subphases touching UI: A3.2, A4.2, A6.3). **Authority: NONE** — not a source of state, rule, or classification; contains no credential, URL, or secret (inspected before commit). Same treatment as `CLAUDE.md`: tooling pointer, not canonical. | `Add local preview launch config` |

## 2. Prevalence rule

The sole active list of documentary authority is in **§1** of
this index. The prevalence rule is: resolve the question by the
document's **role** (state → `PROJECT_STATE.md`; update rule →
`docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md`; classification/authority
→ §1 of this index; commit/diff/HEAD/staging/divergence → Git).

The detailed matrix of **which document to update per type of
phase event** is in
[`docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md`](governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md)
§11 ("Update rule per phase") and §12 ("Minimum documentary
transaction").

The numbered prevalence list that existed in this section was
removed in `G28-DOCS-B3-E1` for being a competitor of §1. Legacy
docs (`docs/superpowers`, `docs/qa`, old docs at the root of
`docs/`) continue to **not** guide execution.

## 3. Current operational runbooks

Folder `docs/operations/`. They document **how to execute**
procedures approved by the canonical sources. When there is
divergence between a runbook and a canonical source, the
canonical sources prevail.

| File | Procedure | Phase |

| File | Procedure | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_USER_PROVISIONING_RUNBOOK.md` | Creation of users (admin/supplier) via Edge Function `admin-create-user` + UI `#/cadastros/usuarios`. Replaces the manual flow of creating an Auth user in Studio and copying the UID. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-AUTH-PROVISIONING-DOCS-A` |
| `AUTH_DISABLE_USER_PROD_RELEASE_PLAN.md` | Production release plan — schema, secrets, Edge Functions, frontend. Required order, rollback, GO/NO-GO. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-AUTH-DISABLE-USER-PROD-RELEASE-PLAN-A` |
| `PARALLEL_ENVIRONMENT_RECONCILIATION.md` | Official environment taxonomy. Legacy vs. parallel, state of each, blockers. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PARALLEL-ENV-RECONCILIATION-A` |

Convention: these runbooks are **docs-only** and
**operational**. Updates must be made in dedicated docs-only
phases.

## 4. Schema / versioned migrations (Supabase)

The `db/` folder contains the canonical schema and the
migrations applied (partially) in staging and production.
**Schema-only** migrations (no destructive deletes) are created
in their own phases and validated by smoke tests before any
application to Supabase. When a migration has **not yet been
applied**, this is explicitly recorded in the file header and
in `PROJECT_STATE.md`.

| File | Purpose | Phase | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `db/01_schema.sql` | Base schema for the app's tables. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-FASE-1` | applied in staging/production |

| `db/11_reset_ops.sql` | Destructive OP reset (bulk DELETE). | — | **DO NOT run** without authorization. |
| `db/12_auth_user_disable_schema.sql` | Support for user deactivation: columns `ativo`, `desativado_em`, `desativado_por`, `motivo_desativacao`; recreation of `is_admin` and `meu_fornecedor_id` to require `ativo is true`; recreation of policies `usuarios_select`, `usuarios_admin_all`, `usuarios_self_update`. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-AUTH-DISABLE-USER-SCHEMA-A` (+ `...-SCHEMA-APPLY-A` + `...-SCHEMA-APPLY-EVIDENCE-A`) | **Applied in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`) on `2026-06-24`, manually by HMNlead in the SQL Editor. Post-application validation: `ativo = true, total = 3`; no destructive column run; `db/10_reset_producao.sql` and `db/11_reset_ops.sql` were not executed; production `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` was not touched. Validated by `tests/auth-disable-user-schema.smoke.js` (20/20) **before** application. |
| `db/13_pedidos_schema.sql` | Client Pedido schema/RLS: tables `pedidos`, `pedido_itens`, `pedido_eventos`; column `lotes.pedido_id` (nullable); admin-only RLS on all 3 tables; indexes on `cliente_id`, `status`, `token_acesso`, `pedido_id`. **Does not** create `pedidos.op_id`. **Does not** create a public policy. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDOS-SCHEMA-RLS-A` (+ `...-SCHEMA-APPLY-UCR-A` + `...-SCHEMA-APPLY-RECORD-A`) | **Applied in ucr** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`) on `2026-06-24` via Management API. Post-application validation: 3 tables created, RLS enabled, admin-only policies, indexes OK, `pedidos.op_id` absent, `lotes.pedido_id` present. Validated by `tests/pedidos-schema.smoke.js` (41/41). Frontend implemented (C1 + C2 + C2-R1 + C3A): listing `#/pedidos`, form `#/pedidos/novo` (admin creation as `rascunho`), color-preview fix (C2-R1), and read-only detail `#/pedidos/<uuid>` (C3A). Focused frontend validation: `pedido-detail.smoke.js` 30/30, `pedido-form.smoke.js` 35/35, `pedido-ui.test.js` 18/18, `pedidos-list.smoke.js` 29/29. **Strictly read-only** in the detail view (no insert/update/delete/rpc, no `functions.invoke`, no `token_acesso`, no public route, no mutation on `lotes`/`pedido_eventos`). |
| `db/14_cliente_perfil_schema.sql` | Authenticated client profile: role `cliente` in `usuarios.tipo` (constraint `usuarios_tipo_check`), column `usuarios.cliente_id` (FK → `public.clientes`), constraint `usuarios_vinculo_exclusivo_check` (admin/supplier/client with exclusive links), function `public.meu_cliente_id()` (SECURITY DEFINER, STABLE; requires `tipo='cliente' AND ativo=true AND cliente_id NOT NULL`; returns NULL on failure), minimal RLS policies for client SELECT/INSERT on `clientes`, `pedidos`, and `pedido_itens`. **Does not** grant client UPDATE/DELETE. **Does not** expose a public token. **Does not** create an anon policy. `pedido_eventos` remains admin-only (internal audit). | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDOS-CLIENTE-SCHEMA-RLS-B1` + `B2` + `B2-RECORD-A` | **Applied in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`) via Management API on `2026-06-24` (phase B2). Status 201, 33 statements. Post validations 23/23: `usuarios_tipo_check` with `cliente`, `usuarios.cliente_id` + FK, `usuarios_vinculo_exclusivo_check`, `meu_cliente_id()` (SECURITY DEFINER, grants OK), 5 client SELECT/INSERT policies, 0 client UPDATE/DELETE policies, 0 anon/token policies, 0 constraint violations. **Gap:** `admin-create-user` and the UI accept only `admin`/`fornecedor`; client-user provisioning pending. |
| `db/15_status_cliente_visual.sql` | Versioned base for B2B client visual tracking: new visual columns on `public.pedidos` (`status_cliente_visual`, `status_cliente_excecao`, `status_cliente_mensagem`, `status_cliente_atualizado_em`, `referencia_cliente`, `prazo_desejado`, `tipo_recebimento`); idempotent TEXT + CHECK checks; table `public.pedido_cliente_eventos`; admin-only RLS on this new table; INSERT guard trigger to prevent the client from publishing visual state; touch trigger for `status_cliente_atualizado_em` on visual updates. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDOS-CLIENTE-TRACKING-SCHEMA-A` + `...-SCHEMA-B` | **Applied and validated in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`) on `2026-06-26`. Structural validations completed: 7 new columns in `pedidos`, 10 columns in `pedido_cliente_eventos`, 4 constraints, 2 triggers, 2 functions, 1 index, `pedido_cliente_eventos = 0`. Client frontend already reads the real `status_cliente_visual`, but does not yet expose `pedido_cliente_eventos`. |
| `db/16_pedido_cliente_eventos_cliente_select.sql` | Versioned RLS policy to grant client-only `SELECT` on `public.pedido_cliente_eventos`, restricted to rows with `visivel_cliente = true` belonging to orders whose `cliente_id = public.meu_cliente_id()`. Preserves the existing admin policy and creates no writes, view, RPC, or trigger. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDOS-CLIENTE-TRACKING-EVENTS-RLS-A` | **Versioned in the repo, not yet applied** in Supabase. Prepares the following staging-apply phase and the client's future read-only timeline. |
| `db/30_cliente_pedido_summary_readmodel.sql` | Public RPC `cliente_pedido_summary(UUID)` for the Pedido detail view in the Client Portal. Encapsulates the internal operational tables behind `SECURITY DEFINER`, authorizes admin or the owning client, returns a simplified JSONB DTO (`pedido`, `itens`, `parciais`, `timeline`, `entregas`, `pendencias`, `etapas`, `chain_state`) and does not publish OP/lot/supplier/invoice/waybill/cost/margin/catalog IDs. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-A-B` (+ `...-APPLY-STAGING-A` + `...-ACL-GRANTS-R1`) | **Function applied and functionally verified in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), confirmed on `2026-07-15` (`CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-APPLY-STAGING-A`, `CLOSED / ACCEPTED_WITH_NONBLOCKING_DEBTS`). `public.cliente_pedido_summary(uuid)` exists with a body byte-for-byte equivalent to the file (**no schema drift**). **`db/30` itself remains absent** from `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` (provenance debt preserved, `DB30_NOT_RECORDED_IN_SUPABASE_MIGRATION_HISTORY`, not repaired). Execution ACL **no broader than the canonical contract**: remediated on `2026-07-15` by the grants-only migration `db/57_cliente_pedido_summary_acl_grants.sql` (see its own row below, phase `CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-ACL-GRANTS-R1`), which revoked `EXECUTE` from `PUBLIC`/`anon`/`service_role`, keeping only `authenticated`. Authenticated browser smoke remains a non-blocking debt (`AUTHENTICATED_BROWSER_SMOKE_NOT_EXECUTED`, no test client password). |
| `db/34_controlled_delete_pedido_op.sql` | RPCs for controlled test/staging physical deletion of Pedido and OP: `diagnosticar_impacto_pedido`, `diagnosticar_impacto_op`, `remover_pedido`, `remover_op`. Removes the legacy trigger `ops_numeradas_no_delete` (db/26) to allow removing a numbered OP without real blockers. Blocks when there is an untreated delivery, Expedição, or child OP; requires `EXCLUIR` confirmation for non-blocking dependencies. `op_numeros` is never altered. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDO-OP-CONTROLLED-DELETE-B` (+ `...-POLICY-FIX-C`) | **Applied and validated only in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`); production `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` untouched. Destructive logic renamed to `*_pre53` by `db/53` (see below); no public API under the original name since then. |
| `db/35_controlled_delete_test_cascade.sql` | Replaces the four `db/34` RPCs with versions that accept a controlled physical cascade (delivery + child OP) when there is no linked Expedição, requiring textual confirmation `EXCLUIR TUDO` (`requires_cascade_confirmation`). Expedição remains a blocker in this migration. `op_numeros` unchanged. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDO-OP-CONTROLLED-DELETE-CASCADE-TEST-D` | **Applied and validated only in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`); production untouched. Functionally replaced by `db/36`/`db/37` in the same Controlled Delete phase; renamed to `*_pre53` by `db/53`. |
| `db/36_controlled_delete_fk_order_fix.sql` | Fixes the transactional order of the `db/35` cascade: builds explicit FK targets (`target_ops`, `target_op_itens`, `target_entregas`, `target_op_latex_links`, `target_child_ops`, `target_child_op_itens`), zeroes `entrega_itens` by `op_id` and by `op_item_id` before removing OPs, and fixes the guards `entrega_cima_latex_guard_fn`/`entrega_itens_cima_latex_guard_fn` to return `OLD` on authorized `DELETE` (avoids silent cancellation). Expedição remains a blocker. `op_numeros` unchanged. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDO-OP-CONTROLLED-DELETE-FK-ORDER-FIX-E` | **Applied and validated only in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`) with a real synthetic test (Pedido #29, OPs 45/46, delivery 21); production untouched. Renamed to `*_pre53` by `db/53`. |
| `db/37_controlled_delete_expedicao_cascade.sql` | Replaces the four `db/36` RPCs (same delivery guards): Expedição stops being an unconditional blocker and becomes part of the `EXCLUIR TUDO` cascade (`expedicao_movimento_itens` → `expedicao_movimentos` → `expedicao_itens` → `expedicoes`, removed before OPs/deliveries/lots/Pedido). `op_numeros` unchanged. See decision `D-DEL14` in `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_SCHEMA_CONTRACT.md` §10. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDO-OP-CONTROLLED-DELETE-EXPEDICAO-CASCADE-E2` | **Applied and validated only in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`); production untouched. Since `db/53`, renamed to `diagnosticar_impacto_pedido_pre53`/`diagnosticar_impacto_op_pre53`/`remover_pedido_pre53`/`remover_op_pre53` (`EXECUTE` revoked from all roles); logic preserved and called by the documentary guard's public wrappers only when eligible. |
| `db/53_controlled_delete_document_link_guard.sql` | Permanent documentary guard between the controlled test physical deletion (Pedido/OP) and the G28 canonical documentary history (`document_link_revisions`/`document_link_revision_ops`). Renames the four `db/37` legacy functions to `*_pre53` (revokes `EXECUTE` from `PUBLIC`/`anon`/`authenticated`/`service_role`) and recreates the original public signatures as `SECURITY DEFINER` wrappers that diagnose documentary history, block when there is a canonical link, and delegate to `*_pre53` only when eligible. Never deletes/alters `document_link_revisions`/`document_link_revision_ops`/`op_numeros`. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CONTROLLED-DELETE-DOCUMENT-LINK-GUARD-B` | **Applied and validated in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), technical commit `707a37bd1d2c4728ab2a17433b6441049bd88062`. `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. Production untouched. See `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_SCHEMA_CONTRACT.md` (decisions `D-DEL10`-`D-DEL13`). |
| `db/54_controlled_delete_document_link_grants.sql` | Staging-only emergency security fix: after `db/53`, the four public RPCs still had `EXECUTE` granted to `PUBLIC`/`anon` from earlier/default grants. Revokes those grants and restricts `EXECUTE` to `authenticated`, without changing the body, `SECURITY DEFINER`, or tables. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CONTROLLED-DELETE-DOCUMENT-LINK-GRANTS-54` | **Applied and validated in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), part of the same technical commit `707a37bd...`. `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. Production untouched. |
| `db/55_controlled_delete_document_link_policy_cast.sql` | Staging-only emergency fix for the already-applied `db/53`: `to_jsonb(<literal>)` without an explicit cast failed with `could not determine polymorphic type`. Forward-only patch (`DO $repair$`) locates and replaces the documentary-policy literal with `to_jsonb(<literal>::TEXT)` in the two already-applied public diagnostic functions. Does not change rules, grants, or cascades. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CONTROLLED-DELETE-DOCUMENT-LINK-POLICY-CAST-55` | **Applied and validated in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), part of the same technical commit `707a37bd...`. `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. Production untouched. |
| `db/56_controlled_delete_document_link_diagnostics_null_safe.sql` | Staging-only emergency fix for a `db/53` regression: `jsonb_set(...)` is `STRICT`, so the entire return of the public diagnostic functions collapsed to `NULL` whenever the target was not blocked by documentary history (`reason` null). Fixed with `COALESCE(to_jsonb(v_reason), 'null'::jsonb)` in the final `jsonb_set` of each diagnostic function, preserving the JSON schema without changing the guard/ACL/`remover_*`/`*_pre53`. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CONTROLLED-DELETE-DOCUMENT-LINK-DIAGNOSTICS-NULL-SAFE-56` | **Applied and validated in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), part of the same technical commit `707a37bd...`. `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. Production untouched. |
| `db/57_cliente_pedido_summary_acl_grants.sql` | Grants-only, forward-only, idempotent migration for `public.cliente_pedido_summary(UUID)`: `REVOKE EXECUTE ... FROM PUBLIC, anon, service_role; GRANT EXECUTE ... TO authenticated`. Does not recreate or alter the function's body, `SECURITY DEFINER`, volatility, `search_path`, owner, signature, or return type. Resolves the ACL divergence recorded in `D-COS06` (`docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_MOVIMENTACAO_DOCUMENTOS_PLANO.md`), closing it in `D-COS07`. | `CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-ACL-GRANTS-R1` | **Applied and verified only in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), `2026-07-15`, via a tracked Supabase MCP migration operation; record `20260715190627 / 57_cliente_pedido_summary_acl_grants` confirmed in the catalog. `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. Final ACL verified live: `PUBLIC` without `EXECUTE`, `anon` without `EXECUTE`, `authenticated` with `EXECUTE`, `service_role` without explicit `EXECUTE` (owner `postgres` retains inherent privilege). Function contract (signature `cliente_pedido_summary(uuid)`, return `jsonb`, `SECURITY DEFINER`, `STABLE`, `search_path=public`, owner `postgres`, body) confirmed byte-for-byte unchanged (identical definition hash before/after). Production (`bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew`) untouched; no push. |
| `db/58_admin_usuarios_senha_temporaria.sql` | Additive, forward-only, idempotent migration (`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`) for phase `A4.1` (`docs/architecture/CAMADA2_USUARIOS_SPEC_PROPOSED.md`): `usuarios.senha_temporaria BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE` + `usuarios.senha_gerada_em TIMESTAMPTZ NULL`. Basis for the single path decided for A4 (temporary password + forced change on first login, A4.2 still `NOT AUTHORIZED`). | `A4.1` | **Applied and verified in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), `2026-07-16`, via Supabase MCP; record `20260716014338 / 58_admin_usuarios_senha_temporaria` confirmed in the catalog. `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. Columns confirmed live with the file's type/nullability/default; the 10 existing users preserved with no retroactive effect (`senha_temporaria=false`, `senha_gerada_em=NULL` for all). Production untouched; no push. |
| `db/59_admin_last_sign_in_readmodel.sql` | RPC `public.admin_usuarios_last_sign_in()` — admin-only read model (`SECURITY DEFINER`, `STABLE`, `search_path=public,auth`), guarded by `is_admin()` (`db/12` pattern) with `RAISE EXCEPTION ... ERRCODE 42501` for a non-admin caller. Returns only `id`+`last_sign_in_at` from `auth.users` for the users visible in `public.usuarios` — does not expose email/password/metadata. Explicit grants: `REVOKE FROM PUBLIC, anon, service_role; GRANT TO authenticated`. Closes the "Last access" column HARD STOP recorded in the `A3.2` closeout. | `CAMADA2-LAST-ACCESS-RPC` | **Applied and verified in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), `2026-07-16`, via Supabase MCP; record `20260716014358 / 59_admin_last_sign_in_readmodel` confirmed in the catalog. `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. Empirical role matrix (`BEGIN...ROLLBACK`): `anon` → `42501` at the ACL boundary (before execution); non-admin `authenticated` → business `42501` (RAISE EXCEPTION inside the function); admin `authenticated` → `ok`, minimal DTO confirmed (only `id`+`last_sign_in_at`). UI consumption (the "Last access" column in `js/screens/admin-usuarios.js`) is its own future micro-phase, `NOT AUTHORIZED` by this record. Production untouched; no push. |
| `db/60_usuarios_auditoria_schema.sql` | Append-only audit table `public.usuarios_eventos` (mirrors `op_eventos`, `db/21`) + trigger `trg_usuario_evento` on `public.usuarios` (`AFTER UPDATE`), recording `ativo`/`tipo`/`nivel_acesso`/`senha_temporaria` diffs as `perfil_alterado` events. Admin-only RLS `SELECT`; no client writes (write path is the `SECURITY DEFINER` trigger only). **Canonical audit-trail design (recorded here, binding):** two write paths reach `usuarios_eventos`, mutually exclusive by the `auth.uid()` condition — (1) the trigger records direct-`UPDATE` changes made by an authenticated admin session (`auth.uid() IS NOT NULL`); (2) the five admin Edge Functions (`db/61`-era, `A6.2`) record their own actions explicitly, since they run under `service_role` where `auth.uid() IS NULL` excludes the trigger by design. Both paths populate the identity snapshot columns (`usuario_email`/`usuario_nome`/`usuario_tipo`, added by `db/61`) — the trigger from `NEW`, the Edge Functions explicitly (no automatic path populates them under `service_role`). | `A6.1` | **Applied and verified in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), `2026-07-16`; record `20260717002523 / 60_usuarios_auditoria_schema` confirmed in the catalog. `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. Role matrix in `BEGIN...ROLLBACK`: trigger fires once per changed watched field, no-op on same-value updates, no double-recording under a simulated `service_role` context; `anon` → `42501`; non-admin `authenticated` → 0 rows (RLS); admin `authenticated` → reads. Production untouched; no push. |
| `db/61_usuarios_eventos_preserve_on_delete.sql` | Corrective migration over `db/60` (not edited — applied, immutable): `usuarios_eventos.usuario_id` FK changed from `ON DELETE CASCADE` to `ON DELETE SET NULL`; adds identity snapshot columns `usuario_email`/`usuario_nome`/`usuario_tipo`; `trigger_usuario_evento()` updated in place to populate them from `NEW`. Root cause: `admin-delete-user` hard-deletes `public.usuarios`, and the original `CASCADE` would destroy an event in the same statement that deletes its subject — architect ruling rejected both `CASCADE` (destroys the trail) and dropping the FK (loses integrity while the subject lives). | `A6.1-B` | **Applied and verified in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), `2026-07-16`; record `20260717003652 / 61_usuarios_eventos_preserve_on_delete` confirmed in the catalog. `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. Full `db/60` role matrix re-verified green under the new schema, plus the delete-survival case: a synthetic profile's event survives its own profile's deletion with `usuario_id` NULL and the identity snapshot intact. Production untouched; no push. |
| `db/62_admin_nivel_acesso_schema.sql` | Additive, forward-only, idempotent (`A2.1`): `public.usuarios.nivel_acesso TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'completo'` + named CHECK `usuarios_nivel_acesso_check (nivel_acesso IN ('completo','somente_leitura'))` (two levels only; NO overrides table, ratified). Helper `public.is_admin_full()` (`plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER STABLE search_path=public,auth`, `EXCEPTION -> FALSE`) requires `ativo IS TRUE AND tipo='admin' AND nivel_acesso='completo'` — same shape as `db/12`'s `is_admin()`, NOT consumed by any policy (modal wiring `A2.2` / route enforcement `A2.3` are separate). `usuarios.tipo` and `is_admin()` untouched (`tipo` anchors all RLS). ACL in-migration (revoke PUBLIC/anon, grant authenticated) — corrected for `service_role` by `db/63`. | `A2.1` | **Applied and verified in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), `2026-07-17`; record `20260717093122 / 62_admin_nivel_acesso_schema`. `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. All 10 existing users defaulted `completo` (no silent privilege change); role matrix green incl. the regression `is_admin()` stays true for a `somente_leitura` admin; `db/60` trigger records the `nivel_acesso` change (`perfil_alterado`, correct payload); CHECK rejects invalid values. Production untouched; no push. |
| `db/63_is_admin_full_grants.sql` | Grants-only, forward-only, idempotent ACL correction over `db/62` (`A2.1-B`, precedent `db/57`). Root cause: `db/62` left `service_role` with `EXECUTE` via Supabase default function privileges, diverging from the db/54/57 authenticated-only standard on that row (harmless — `service_role` is server-only, bypasses RLS, `is_admin_full()` returns FALSE under it). States the COMPLETE intended ACL: `REVOKE ALL FROM PUBLIC, anon, service_role; GRANT EXECUTE TO authenticated`. Encountered as the architect-named hard stop ("ACL diverging"); ruled Option 3 (forward-only new migration). | `A2.1-B` | **Applied and verified in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), `2026-07-17`; record `20260717101401 / 63_is_admin_full_grants`. `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. Final catalog ACL `[postgres, authenticated]` only; `has_function_privilege` → authenticated `true`, anon/service_role `false`; runtime `service_role` call → `42501` (helper unreachable); authenticated admin path unchanged. Production untouched; no push. |
| `db/65_ordem_compra_lifecycle_schema.sql` | Additive, forward-only, idempotent schema for the purchase-order lifecycle (`ORDEM_COMPRA_LIFECYCLE_SPEC_PROPOSED.md`, `RATIFIED`): 12 new columns on `ordens_compra_fio` (three orthogonal dimensions — `status_administrativo`/`status_aceite`/`status_recebimento` — + audit columns + `aceite_exigido_na_emissao` freeze snapshot); new tables `ordem_compra_fio_lancamentos` (receipt ledger, empty/no trigger yet), `ordem_compra_eventos` (transition audit, `op_eventos`/`usuarios_eventos` pattern), `ordem_compra_config` (singleton, seeded `exige_aceite=false`); one-time legacy-marking backfill in the same transaction as the `ALTER TABLE` (binding gap 1). Admin-only RLS read, no client writes, on all three new tables (db/57/63 grants standard). No RPC, no UI, no JS change. | `ORDEM-COMPRA-LIFECYCLE` Phase `A` | **Applied and verified in staging** (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), `2026-07-18`, via `supabase-legacy` MCP; record `20260718110246 / 65_ordem_compra_lifecycle_schema`. `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. 14/14 verification-matrix checks (`BEGIN…ROLLBACK`, synthetic, cleanup confirmed zero) — legacy backfill mapping, new-order defaults, config default, events-table role matrix (anon `42501` / non-admin `0` rows / admin reads), all five dimension `CHECK` constraints. Production (`gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk`) untouched; `git push production dev` authorized (remote backup only, not `main`). |
| `db/66_ordem_compra_emitir_cancelar.sql` | Flat-model emit/cancel RPCs and lifecycle ACL transition retained for imported legacy coexistence. | `ORDEM-COMPRA-LIFECYCLE` Phase `B1` | **Applied and accepted in staging**; historical flat authority retained only within the documented coexistence boundary. |

### Static smoke tests for versioned schema

| File | Purpose | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `tests/cliente-tracking-schema.smoke.js` | Static validation of `db/15_status_cliente_visual.sql`: new columns, visual taxonomy, exceptions, `pedido_cliente_eventos`, admin-only RLS, INSERT guard trigger, UPDATE touch trigger, and absence of destructive commands/secrets. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDOS-CLIENTE-TRACKING-SCHEMA-A` |
| `tests/cliente-events-rls-schema.smoke.js` | Static validation of `db/16_pedido_cliente_eventos_cliente_select.sql`: file existence, policy `pedido_cliente_eventos_cliente_select`, `FOR SELECT`, filter `visivel_cliente = true`, ownership via `public.pedidos` + `public.meu_cliente_id()`, absence of client writes, and absence of improper scope. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDOS-CLIENTE-TRACKING-EVENTS-RLS-A` |
| `tests/cliente-tracking-steps.smoke.js` | Static and sandboxed validation of `js/pedido-tracking-ui.js`: global namespace, 8 main steps, 4 exceptions, pure helpers, fallback to `recebido`, absence of forbidden internal terms, and absence of query/write. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDOS-CLIENTE-TRACKING-STEPS-A` |
| `tests/admin-pedido-tracking-control.smoke.js` | Static validation of the admin control for publishing visual tracking: new module `js/screens/pedido-tracking-admin.js`, integration with `pedido-detail.js`, use of the shared taxonomy, writes to `pedidos.status_cliente_*` and `pedido_cliente_eventos`, separation from operational status, and absence of functional changes in the client/supplier screens. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDOS-CLIENTE-TRACKING-ADMIN-A` |
| `tests/pedido-parciais-admin-control.smoke.js` | Static validation of the manual admin control for partials: new module `js/screens/pedido-parciais-admin.js`, integration with `pedido-detail.js`, explicit SELECT and controlled insert into `pedido_parciais`, reuse of the shared catalog `CLIENTE_PARCIAL_SITUACOES`, absence of mandatory use of `pedido_parcial_itens`, and absence of functional changes in the client screens. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CLIENTE-PARCIAIS-ADMIN-CONTROL-A` |
| `tests/cliente-dashboard.smoke.js` | Static validation of the read-only Client Dashboard: existence of the module `js/screens/cliente-dashboard.js`, route `#/cliente/dashboard` (client role), "Início" menu, explicit SELECT on pedidos restricted to allowed fields, `pedido_cliente_eventos` with only safe columns, absence of `metadata`/`criado_por`/`origem`/`pedido_eventos`, use of the `window.RavatexPedidoTracking` taxonomy, rendering of KPIs/recent pedidos/updates, and absence of writes/`service_role`/internal data. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CLIENTE-DASHBOARD-A` |
| `tests/cliente-pedido-summary-readmodel.smoke.js` | Static validation of the public RPC `cliente_pedido_summary(UUID)`: permission for admin or the owning client, `SECURITY DEFINER`, `search_path`, grant only to `authenticated`, public DTO, absence of forbidden internal keys, partials/timeline only with `visivel_cliente IS TRUE`, and absence of destructive writes. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-A-B` |
| `tests/ordem-compra-lifecycle-schema.smoke.js` | Static validation of `db/65_ordem_compra_lifecycle_schema.sql`: all 12 new `ordens_compra_fio` columns/defaults/`CHECK`s, the three new tables' shape/index/RLS/grants (admin-only `SELECT`, no client writes), the single-transaction `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` wrapper around the `ALTER TABLE` + legacy backfill, the backfill's `status`→`status_recebimento` mapping, a scope guard (no RPC/trigger/dimension-column `REVOKE` — Phase B/C/D territory), absence of destructive commands/secrets, and non-regression of `db/63`/`db/64`. | `ORDEM-COMPRA-LIFECYCLE` Phase `A` |
| `tests/ordem-compra-emitir-cancelar.smoke.js` | Static validation of the `db/66` flat emit/cancel lifecycle boundary. | `ORDEM-COMPRA-LIFECYCLE` Phase `B1` |
| `tests/ordem-compra.smoke.js` | Consolidated native purchase-order refoundation and administration coverage, including `db/67`-`db/69` contracts and application surfaces. Documentation Correction R2 changes no test artifact; focused tests must be updated only in the separately authorized implementation. | `REFUND-A` / `REFUND-B1` / `PRE-PROD-A-R1` |
| `tests/ordem-compra-native-receipt.smoke.js` | Static/contract coverage of `db/70` native receipt, reversal, ledger, and narrow inventory integration. Existing evidence remains accepted; shared NULL-OP coverage is a future focused revalidation requirement. | `PHASE-C2` |
| `tests/ordem-compra-c3a-cutover-foundation.smoke.js` | Static coverage of the inactive C3A cutover/opening-balance foundation (`db/71`, extended for `db/73`). | `PHASE-C3A` / `PHASE-C3A-R2` |
| `tests/ordem-compra-c3a-cutover-initial-state.smoke.js` | Static coverage of the protected inactive singleton in `db/72`. | `PHASE-C3A-R1` |

| `tests/ordem-compra-c3c-inactive-concurrency.mjs` | Distinct-session runtime proof for session advisory exclusion, deterministic eight-stage resource blocking, release/reacquisition, zero deadlocks, and idle final backend state. | `PHASE-C3C-A` |

### Frontend modules for visual tracking

| File | Role | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `js/pedido-tracking-ui.js` | Shared layer of visual taxonomy and pure helpers for status, message, and progress of client tracking. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDOS-CLIENTE-TRACKING-STEPS-A` |
| `js/screens/pedido-tracking-admin.js` | Admin card to publish the status visible to the client, with preview and auditable writes to `pedidos.status_cliente_*` and `pedido_cliente_eventos`. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-PEDIDOS-CLIENTE-TRACKING-ADMIN-A` |
| `js/screens/pedido-parciais-admin.js` | Admin card to list and manually register Pedido partials in `pedido_parciais`, reusing the shared catalog `CLIENTE_PARCIAL_SITUACOES` and a simple technical preview via `buildPedidoAcompanhamentoParcial`, with no client read and without activating `pedido_parcial_itens`. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CLIENTE-PARCIAIS-ADMIN-CONTROL-A` |
| `js/screens/cliente-dashboard.js` | Read-only Client Dashboard (`#/cliente/dashboard`, `screenClienteDashboard`): the B2B portal's home page. Locally derived cards/KPIs, recent pedidos, and latest updates. Explicit SELECT on `pedidos` (safe fields) and `pedido_cliente_eventos` (`id, pedido_id, status, titulo, mensagem, criado_em`). No writes, no `metadata`/`criado_por`/`origem`, no `pedido_eventos`, no exposure of `OP`/`lote`/`fornecedor`/`NF`/`romaneio`/`custo`/`margem`. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CLIENTE-DASHBOARD-A` |
| `js/screens/cliente-pedido-detail.js` | Pedido detail view in the Client Portal. As of `CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-A-B`, consumes only `supa.rpc('cliente_pedido_summary')` and does not directly query internal operational tables such as `ops`, `lotes`, `op_itens`, `entregas`, `expedicoes`, or `ordens_compra_fio`. | `RAVATEX-TAPETES-CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-A-B` |

## 4. Legacy docs (DOES NOT GUIDE EXECUTION (NÃO GUIAM EXECUÇÃO))

Preserved for historical context. Each folder or file carries its own
banner. If used, **adapt to the current architecture** and confirm
against canonical sources.

### `docs/superpowers/`

Content from project phases 1-7. Includes `STATUS.md`, `specs/` and
`plans/`.

| Type | Classification | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `STATUS.md` | Historical | Phases 1-6 listed; assumes pre-refactor architecture. |
| `specs/*.md` (9 files) | Obsolete | Designs written for the monolithic `index.html`. The architecture has since been modularized. |
| `plans/*.md` (9 files) | **DANGEROUS FOR AI (PERIGOSO PARA IA)** | Instructs modifying `index.html` directly, with inline Supabase writes and `git add .`. **Do not follow literally.** |

> Before using any spec/plan here as a functional requirement,

### `docs/qa/`

QA checklists and scripts from phases 1-6 + Phase 6 script.

| Type | Classification | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `fase1-checklist.md`, `fase2-checklist.md` | Historical + anonymized credentials | Could contain test passwords; anonymized in `RAVATEX-TAPETES-DOCS-SANITIZE-A`. |

## 5. Critical warnings

### Plans in `docs/superpowers/plans/`

The plans describe direct modifications to `index.html`, inline
Supabase writes, `git add .`, and a workflow without staging.
**Following them literally would reintroduce the pre-refactor
monolith**, violating `docs/architecture/CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md` §2
and §6.

> Treat the plans as a **historical record of intent** from the old
> phases, not as an executable playbook.

### Old credentials in `docs/qa/`

`docs/qa/fase1-checklist.md` and `docs/qa/fase2-checklist.md`
contained test passwords (e.g. `Admin123!`, `Fornec123!`). They
were **anonymized** in `RAVATEX-TAPETES-DOCS-SANITIZE-A`, replaced
with `[REDACTED_TEST_PASSWORD]`. Do not trust any credential found
in legacy docs; rotate if necessary.

### `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` and `docs/AI_AGENT_RULES.md`

Both docs were written in a context prior to the `staging`/`origin`
split and modularization. Today there is:

- remote `staging` (`controle-tapetes-staging`), the default push
  destination on `work/app-next`;
- remote `origin` (`grupoterrabranca/controle-tapes`), which is
  production and has been **untouched** since the refactor phase;
- Supabase staging ref `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`;
- Supabase production ref `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew`.

The current rule is in `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` (rules 1, 2, 3, 15) and in
`docs/architecture/CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md` §15.

## 6. Policy for updating this index

- Update this index when there is a change to the authority list
  in §1, a new classificatory document (enters the §1 inventory), a
  new runbook (enters §3), or a new category of legacy docs (enters
  §4).
- §1 is the only active documentary-authority list; no other
  section of this index and no other file should keep a competing
  list of "canonical sources", "prevalence", or "precedence".
- Phase: docs-only. No functional change.
- Updating the index is governed by the **update matrix by phase**
  in `docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md` §11 and by the
  **minimum documentary transaction** §12 of the same model.
  Changes to authority, classification, or paths require a review
  of this index; cosmetic changes should be avoided.
- The competing lists that existed in the former §2 "Prevalence
  rule" of this index, in
  `docs/architecture/CLAUDE_PROJECT_ASSET_MAP.md`, and in
  `Guide-and-governance-rules.stxt` were reconciled in
  `G28-DOCS-B3-E1`: they now point to §1. The history of this
  reconciliation is in `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md`.

## 7. Documentation language migration (DOC-LANGUAGE-MIGRATION) and pt-BR archive

The `DOC-LANGUAGE-MIGRATION` track progressively translates the
canonical documentation into English, in batches authorized by their
own order. Each translated file has its pt-BR original **moved**, in
the same commit, to `docs/archive/pt-BR/<original-path>`
(byte-for-byte preservation; not operational, historical reference
only). File names, anchors, paths and cross-references remain
**unchanged** — only the content is translated. The canonical status
vocabulary (`CLOSED`, `ACCEPTED`, `NOT AUTHORIZED`, `DEFERRED`,
`PROPOSED`, `HARD STOP`, `READ-ONLY` etc.) remains verbatim. Starting
with `DOC-LANGUAGE-MIGRATION-L2`, architect decisions and blocks
previously kept in Portuguese in the canonical homes also start being
translated into English, marked with a provenance note
(`translated from the architect's original Portuguese; original in
docs/archive/pt-BR/`); the original pt-BR wording preserved in the
file remains authoritative in any dispute over nuance. Ledgers and
`docs/handoffs/` are **not** translated.

The current language policy is recorded in the canonical homes:
`docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md` (§18, "Language policy"),
`docs/architecture/CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md` (§19, "Rule for language") and
`docs/governance/SUPERVISION_PROTOCOL.md` (§3, language line in the
order format). `CLAUDE.md` keeps a pointer summary pointing to these
homes.

### Batch `DOC-LANGUAGE-MIGRATION-L1`

| Canonical path (now in English) | Archived pt-BR original |
|---|---|
| `docs/architecture/CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md` | `docs/archive/pt-BR/docs/architecture/CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md` |

|---|---|
| `PROJECT_STATE.md` | `docs/archive/pt-BR/PROJECT_STATE.md` |
| `AGENT_HANDOFF.md` | `docs/archive/pt-BR/AGENT_HANDOFF.md` |

In `L2`, besides the translation, the language policy was adjusted:
architect orders can be issued in Portuguese, but once recorded in the
canonical documents they are written in English, with the original
wording preserved in the ledger or archive file.
`docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md` §18, `CLAUDE.md` and the
language line of `docs/governance/SUPERVISION_PROTOCOL.md` §3 were
updated in the same commit; the supervision handoff appendix block
(template, not a signed decision) was translated into English, with
the pt-BR original preserved in the `L1` file.

### Batch `DOC-LANGUAGE-MIGRATION-L3`

| Canonical path (now in English) | Archived pt-BR original |

| `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` (this file) | `docs/archive/pt-BR/docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` |

In `L3`, the remaining active specs, plans, contracts, reports, and
runbooks were translated (19 files) — the last lot of documents still
in Portuguese, closing the `DOC-LANGUAGE-MIGRATION` track for
currently-scoped canonical documents. Explicitly excluded from L3, by
architect ruling, as historical/quarantined and left in Portuguese:
`docs/qa/*`, `docs/superpowers/*`, the root `docs/*.md` legacy files
listed in §4 (`DEPLOYMENT.md`, `AI_AGENT_RULES.md`,
`BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `STAGING_BASELINE.md`), and the
byte-immutable `docs/legacy/pre-model/` snapshots. Ledgers and
`docs/handoffs/` remain untranslated per standing policy. Phase IDs
and their embedded terms (e.g. `Camada N`) are never translated, per
`docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md` §18.

The files under `docs/archive/pt-BR/` are immutable preservation (not
operational); in case of divergence, the canonical English file
prevails.
