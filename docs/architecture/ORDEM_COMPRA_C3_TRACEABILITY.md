## Accepted foundation

`PHASE-C3C-A` is `CLOSED / TECHNICALLY ACCEPTED — LOCALLY VERIFIED /
INACTIVE / NOT APPLIED TO STAGING` at technical checkpoint
`89123729b3529fff6e4a2336bfec2907c4b94b4c`. It supplies the inactive database
foundation: state/fence, canonical database reader and commands, frozen snapshot,
idempotent import, reconciliation, locks, ACL-closure command, and recovery
boundaries. Application adapters, inactive staging deployment/rehearsal, real
cutover, C4 UI, and C5 emission remain incomplete or deferred as shown below.

## Requirement matrix

Allowed dispositions: `SATISFIED`, `PARTIALLY_SATISFIED`, `PLANNED`, `DEFERRED`,
`BLOCKED`, `NOT_APPLICABLE`, `SUPERSEDED`.

## Authorization boundary

C3C-B is the next product lot but is unauthorized and has no phase contract.
C3D, staging application/validation, deployment, activation, real snapshot/import,
fence transition, read switch, final ACL-closure invocation, cutover, C4, C5,
production, `main`, remotes, and push remain unauthorized.
