# ACTIVE OPERATIONAL HANDOFF

- **`PRODUCTION-READINESS-DIAGNOSIS-R1` ratified + `BACKLOG FREEZE` —
  `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17):** the architect authorized a read-only
  whole-system migration diagnosis (move to a new repo + new Supabase project +
  Vercel, then deploy) and, on delivery, ratified it. **Docs-only closeout** —
  no code, no push, no production access. Outcomes recorded in canon:
  (1) the diagnosis is a **ratified reference report**
  (`docs/reports/PRODUCTION_READINESS_DIAGNOSIS_R1_2026-07-17.md`, precedent
  `BACKLOG_RECONCILIATION_R1`); (2) the **publication criterion is amended** —
  publication proceeds with Camada 3 at `BK4.2`, remaining Camada-3 scope +
  the two `PRE-PUBLICATION` asterisks become `POST-LAUNCH DEBT` with production
  consequences, the reviewer objection (minimum pre-launch set) recorded and
  **overruled**; (3) a **`BACKLOG FREEZE`** is in force — no new fronts until
  after cutover (`M10`); only the `M0`-`M10` plan and the canonical residual
  risk register are authorizable; (4) the **residual risk register (12 items,
  ranked)** is now canonical (report §4, mirrored in `PROJECT_STATE.md`);
  (5) the **`M0`-`M10` migration plan** is the active track, every phase
  `NOT AUTHORIZED` pending its own order; (6) canon corrected: branch commit
  count is **749**, not "~555". **Target coordinates (all new, empty):** GitHub
  `inttexsystem/inttracker`, Supabase `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk` (new-format
  `sb_publishable_…` key supplied), Vercel `vercel.com/inttex`. A separate tiny
  technical commit first added `supabase/.temp/` to `.gitignore` (the 8 untracked
  CLI-cache files leaked the project ref + pooler URL, and `M0` will push 749
  commits). **Next authorizable action:** an individual order for `M0` (new repo
  landing — full-history push) or any `M0`-`M10` phase. Full detail:
  `docs/reports/PRODUCTION_READINESS_DIAGNOSIS_R1_2026-07-17.md`.
- **`BK4.2` (the exporter — first real execution + restore-smoke) —
  `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17):** the exporter's code
  (`scripts/backup/export-db.mjs` + `scripts/backup/lib/*`, commits
  `4831ca3`/`75f8ff9`/`153b2a2`/`51c4633`/`e11d05e`) was already
  committed to this branch prior to this closeout. This entry records
  the architect-authorized order to (1) determine which OAuth client
  the successful real run actually used, read-only, before closing,
  and (2) close `BK4.2` with the resolved answer, the restore-smoke
  evidence, a contract note on bundle secrecy, and the state of
  `CAMADA3-DRIVE-ACTIVATION`/`CAMADA3-TRIGGER-SELECTION`. **No new code
  was written in this closeout** — verification-only, followed by a
  docs-only commit.
  **Claim verification (a third-party relay via ChatGPT reported
  success — verified independently before trusting it, per this
  project's own supervision rule that ChatGPT has no state custody):**
  bundle `backups/ravatex-backup-20260717T171339Z.tar.gz` on disk, its
  independently recomputed SHA-256
  (`dab5bb03422e3662af471d30d77091f98afb7199199897e7f6f1c22a13977c2`),
  and the live `backup_runs`/`backup_run_destinations` rows in staging
  (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`) all matched exactly — `backup_runs.id =
  ae55e714-3f58-49b0-957d-7b959de7b630`, `status=completed`,
  `bytes=83378`, `google_drive=ok` (`uploaded_at` recorded),
  `onedrive=skipped`. The `row_count_manifest` matched the reported
  highlights exactly (`auth.users=10`, `auth.identities=8`,
  `public.usuarios=10`, `public.ops=8`, `public.pedidos=4`,
  `storage_buckets_count=0`). A prior attempt (`backup_runs.id =
  0ab0c04b-...`) failed with `invalid_grant: Token has been expired or
  revoked` — a stale previously-copied token, not a client/credential
  mismatch — retained as legitimate history, not remediated.
  **Restore-smoke drill performed and passed (mechanism proof; not yet
  `BK8`'s formalized/repeatable cadence):** a permission check correctly
  blocked a first attempt to `head` the extracted `auth_full.sql` (which
  would have printed real password hashes/session data from staging
  into this transcript) — every subsequent check used structural greps
  or `count(*)`/boolean queries only, never row content. Spun up an
  isolated local scratch PostgreSQL 18.4 cluster (ephemeral port, temp
  data dir, never staging/production); restored `auth_full.sql` →
  `schema_public.sql` → `data_public.sql`, **zero errors** across all
  three (no extension/role dependencies — the `--no-owner
  --no-privileges` dumps are self-contained). Compared **all 63
  restored tables** (40 `public` + 23 `auth`) against the bundle's own
  manifest: **63/63 match, 0 mismatches**, `auth.identities=8`
  explicitly confirmed — this is the concrete resolution, in mechanism,
  of the `auth.identities` restore-fidelity gap the original diagnosis
  (`G28-CAMADA-3-DIAGNOSIS-R1`) flagged against the pre-existing
  `auth.users`-only runbook. Referential integrity: `0` orphaned
  `auth.identities`, `0` orphaned `public.usuarios`→`auth.users` FK
  rows (`CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md` §11's invariant, cross-schema);
  all 10 users carry a non-empty password hash (structural proof a real
  login is possible — no actual login attempted, since that needs a
  real password not handled in this pass); canonical history intact
  (`document_link_revisions=8`, `usuarios_eventos=9`). Scratch cluster
  stopped and every extracted/temp file (real staging credentials)
  removed immediately after verification — nothing persisted.
  **OAuth client — resolved via Google's own infrastructure, not
  inferred:** two different OAuth client JSON files existed locally in
  `.ravatex-local/` (the Documents Ingestor's own client,
  `...eh26scjc...`, and an apparently-unused second one,
  `...9v4j8gv9...`, dated 2026-07-11, predating today's reuse decision
  — likely a leftover from `BK4.2`'s originally-designed dedicated
  grant). The one logged manual `login` attempt used the Ingestor's
  client but failed ("No code received"); no log captured the
  successful token's origin. Resolved definitively by calling Google's
  own `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/tokeninfo` endpoint against the
  successful run's still-valid access token (a read-only introspection
  needing only the access token, never a client secret): both `aud` and
  `azp` resolved to `334691504707-eh26scjcmgetfrmfsc2ndgi8de6kdb07
  .apps.googleusercontent.com` — confirmed against the Documents
  Ingestor's own `.env` at the separate, standalone repo
  `D:\OneDrive\Programação\Ravatex\documents-ingestor\` (unrelated to
  this repo's `services/documents-ingestor/` copy). **The successful
  run reused the Ingestor's OAuth client, not a dedicated grant** —
  contradicting `CAMADA3_BACKUP_CONTRACT.md` §4's original premise.
  **Registered live debt, `CAMADA3-OAUTH-GRANT-COUPLING`, `NOT
  AUTHORIZED`:** rotating/revoking the Ingestor's OAuth grant would also
  break backups; architect must decide to formalize the reuse (rewriting
  §4) or build a genuinely separate client. **Contract amended**
  (`docs/architecture/CAMADA3_BACKUP_CONTRACT.md`): §4 now carries a
  dated amendment recording this finding in full; §6 gained a binding
  "bundle contents are secrets" rule (drills inspect structure/counts
  only, never row content; bundles gitignored, never committed); the BK
  sequence table and status banners updated to `BK4.1`/`BK4.2 = CLOSED /
  ACCEPTED`; a full "Amendment 2026-07-17" section added before
  `STRUCTURAL POLICY COMPLIANCE`. **Registered:**
  `CAMADA3-DRIVE-ACTIVATION` — partially exercised (one real upload
  succeeded) but `NOT AUTHORIZED` as a standing/repeated capability
  (`BK5`/`BK6`/trigger/OAuth-coupling all still pending);
  `CAMADA3-TRIGGER-SELECTION` — still deferred, unchanged. **No
  Supabase writes beyond the two already-recorded runs; no push; no
  production access.** Documentation commit only, per the order.
  **Next authorizable action:** `BK5` (read-only UI panel +
  manual-trigger write), own order, mockup gate first — or resolution of
  the OAuth-coupling decision, which several later subphases may want
  settled first. Full detail: `docs/architecture/CAMADA3_BACKUP_CONTRACT.md`.
- **`BK4.1` (`backup_runs` schema) — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17):**
  per `docs/architecture/CAMADA3_BACKUP_CONTRACT.md`. Technical commit
  `d39a848` — `Add backup runs schema` (`db/64_backup_runs_schema.sql`,
  `tests/backup-runs-schema.smoke.js`). **Two new tables:**
  `public.backup_runs` (append-only run record — `started_at`,
  `finished_at`, `status` `running|completed|failed`, `scope` locked to
  the single ratified value `'public+auth'` via CHECK, `bytes`, `sha256`
  format-checked, `row_count_manifest` JSONB object-checked,
  `triggered_by` `scheduled|manual`, `retention_class` `gfs|manual` —
  kept as a field distinct from `triggered_by` since a scheduled run can
  still be pinned `manual` retention by operator decision) and
  `public.backup_run_destinations` (child table, one row per
  `(run_id, destination)`, `ON DELETE CASCADE`; `status`
  `pending|ok|failed|skipped`; `ok` requires `uploaded_at`, `failed`
  requires `error`). **Destination-model decision (per the order's
  request for justification): child table, not a JSONB column** — makes
  "Drive OK / OneDrive skipped" a first-class row rather than a parsed
  blob, matches the contract's per-destination status/last-error
  requirement directly. **`destination` is deliberately an open `TEXT`
  field with only a non-empty/lowercase format check, no `CHECK` enum**
  (contract §4 explicitly demands N-destination extensibility without
  schema rework — adding OneDrive must never require a migration) — this
  is the one deliberate asymmetry against `scope`, which IS `CHECK`-locked
  to the single value `'public+auth'` (the contract treats any scope
  change as its own gated revision event, unlike destinations). **Writer
  path:** two `service_role`-only RPCs, `iniciar_backup_run`/
  `finalizar_backup_run`, mirroring `db/38`'s
  `iniciar_document_scan_run`/`finalizar_document_scan_run` two-phase
  shape and `db/49`'s internal `auth.role() = 'service_role'` gate (not
  relied upon via `GRANT` alone — the exporter has no JWT, same
  authorization path as the admin Edge Functions).
  `finalizar_backup_run` writes the terminal run row **and** every
  `backup_run_destinations` row for that run in one call/transaction — a
  malformed destination element aborts the whole call (intentional
  fail-loud behavior; this writer is internal-only, its sole caller is
  the future exporter). **RLS/ACL:** admin-only `SELECT` on both tables,
  **no `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` policy for any client role on either
  table** (append-only intent enforced structurally, stricter than
  `db/38`'s admin-`FOR ALL` precedent — even an admin session cannot
  write directly; only the `SECURITY DEFINER` RPCs, which write as table
  owner and bypass RLS by ownership, not by a permissive policy). Full,
  explicit ACL stated in the migration itself (`db/57`/`db/63` standard):
  `REVOKE ALL` from `PUBLIC`/`anon`/`authenticated`/`service_role` on
  both tables, `GRANT SELECT` to `authenticated` only (admin-gated by
  RLS); `REVOKE ALL` from `PUBLIC`/`anon`/`authenticated` on both RPCs,
  `GRANT EXECUTE` to `service_role` only. **Staging (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`,
  confirmed via `usuarios.nivel_acesso`/`db/62` fingerprint): applied and
  verified.** Registry `20260717125153 / 64_backup_runs_schema`
  (pre-state clean — neither table existed). **Role-matrix verification
  (`BEGIN…ROLLBACK`, synthetic, cleanup zero — confirmed `0` rows in both
  tables post-rollback):** anon `SELECT` → `42501`; non-admin
  authenticated `SELECT` → `0` rows (RLS); admin authenticated `SELECT` →
  reads correctly; anon/admin-authenticated calling either RPC directly →
  `42501` (only `service_role` has `EXECUTE`); `service_role` DB role with
  a **mismatched** JWT `role` claim → internal gate still fires
  (`writer_required`) — proves the internal check is not redundant
  dead code layered under the `GRANT`; `service_role` (DB role + aligned
  JWT claim) opens a run, finalizes it `completed` with **two destination
  rows in one call (`google_drive:ok` + `onedrive:skipped`)** — read back
  correctly by an admin session, exact match; a second run finalized
  `failed` with one `failed` destination — also correct; double-finalize
  of an already-`completed` run → graceful `run_not_running_or_not_found`,
  not a crash; `finalizar_backup_run`'s three graceful-error branches
  (`error_required_when_failed`, `row_count_manifest_invalid`,
  `destinations_invalid`) all fire correctly on malformed input;
  `service_role` attempting a **raw** table write (bypassing the RPC) →
  `42501` (service_role has zero direct table grant); admin authenticated
  attempting `UPDATE`/`DELETE` on either table → `42501` (append-only
  intent holds even for an admin session). **17/17 checks passed.**
  **Tests:** `tests/backup-runs-schema.smoke.js`, 17/17 (static
  assertions — columns/defaults, all `CHECK` constraints, the
  `scope`-locked-vs-`destination`-open asymmetry, RLS/grants completeness,
  both RPC signatures/gates/validation branches, no destructive DDL/no
  secrets, `db/62`/`db/63` non-regression). Purely additive change (two
  new files, zero existing files modified) — **134 pre-existing failures
  unchanged by construction** (documented flakiness class, unrelated to
  this phase), `+17` new tests all passing, full suite `3792` tests /
  `3658` pass. **Forbidden and honored:** no exporter (`BK4.2`), no UI
  (`BK5`), no retention pruning (`BK6`), no CI config, no production, no
  push. **Next authorizable action:** `BK4.2` (the exporter), own order —
  its own risk gate per the contract (DB credential + `auth`-schema
  handling). Full detail: `docs/architecture/CAMADA3_BACKUP_CONTRACT.md`.
- **`G28-CAMADA-3-DIAGNOSIS-R1` (read-only diagnosis) + `BK3` (backup
  contract) — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17):** the architect authorized
  a read-only diagnosis of `G28-CAMADA-3` (automated backup — the second
  half of the publication criterion, `G28-GOVERNANCE-CONSOLIDATION-A`),
  mirroring the `G28-CAMADA-2` diagnosis approach. Sources: the master
  plan's CAMADA 3 section (`BK1-BK8`), the existing manual runbook
  (`docs/BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md`), the live repo/schema state, and
  `SGAA_clean_baseline`'s backup subsystem (read-only, functional/UX
  reference only — same caveat discipline as Camada 2: stack-specific
  engine/scheduler/restore assumptions rejected, only information
  architecture borrowed). Findings, verified against live staging
  (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`, confirmed by the presence of `usuarios.
  nivel_acesso`/`db/62`): 0 Supabase Storage buckets/objects (document
  bytes are Drive-first, Postgres holds only pointers); `public` schema
  now ≈40 tables (38 confirmed live base tables), `auth` schema has 23
  base tables (not just `auth.users`); `pg_cron`/`pg_net`/`http` are
  available but not enabled; only 14 of 63 migrations are recorded in
  `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` (partial/unreliable — the repo's
  `db/*.sql` remains the authoritative schema source); append-only
  canonical history confirmed present (`document_link_revisions`=8,
  `document_link_revision_ops`=10, `usuarios_eventos`=9). **Architect
  ratified the diagnosis "as reported"** and issued three scope/trigger/
  destination decisions (see `docs/architecture/CAMADA3_BACKUP_CONTRACT.md`,
  "Architect decisions incorporated"): (1) scope = `public` data + the
  **full `auth` schema** (not just `auth.users` — a restore without
  `auth.identities` cannot log in), document bytes explicitly out of
  scope by design (Drive-first), Storage re-verified as 0 buckets every
  cycle; (2) the automated **trigger is deferred** (GH Actions vs. Vercel
  cron, decided with hosting) — the exporter must be trigger-agnostic,
  self-contained, idempotent, parameterized, invokable by any future
  scheduler or by hand, with zero scheduling logic inside the exporter
  itself (registered `CAMADA3-TRIGGER-SELECTION`, `NOT AUTHORIZED`, blocks
  the "automated" half of the publication criterion); (3) **multi-
  destination by design** (SGAA's per-provider pattern) — Google Drive
  primary, implemented now (reuses the Ingestor's OAuth pattern); OneDrive
  interface-ready, not configured, ships disabled with its wiring in
  place; `backup_runs` and the exporter must never hardcode a single-
  destination assumption. **Order `BK3` (docs-only)** then produced
  `docs/architecture/CAMADA3_BACKUP_CONTRACT.md` (`PROPOSED`, ratified as
  the binding premise for all later subphases): scope (§1), cadence/
  retention — GFS 4-window model, manual backups never expire (§2);
  integrity — SHA-256 + per-table row-count manifest as the restore
  assertion baseline (§3); N-destination contract (§4); the
  trigger-agnostic exporter contract — inputs/outputs/exit codes/
  idempotency/secrets-never-in-repo/`backup_runs` recording (§5); the
  restore SLO + drill contract — monthly + after every migration, scratch
  target only, proof = row counts match + a real login succeeds (proves
  `auth.identities` restored) + append-only history intact (§6); explicit
  limits — production restore never rehearsed against production, account/
  vendor loss out of scope, trigger deferred (§7); and the stale-docs
  finding (`docs/BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md`/`STAGING_BASELINE.md` describe a
  pre-Documents world — refresh registered as part of `BK7`, not fixed
  here) (§8). **BK1/BK2 closed by the diagnosis; BK3 closed by this
  contract; `BK4.1`-`BK8` and `CAMADA3-TRIGGER-SELECTION` remain `NOT
  AUTHORIZED`, each pending its own order — phases do not chain
  automatically.** No file changed outside this docs-only commit; no
  Supabase write; no production access; no push. **Next authorizable
  action:** `BK4.1` (`backup_runs` schema + service_role writer RPC), own
  order — or `CAMADA3-TRIGGER-SELECTION` if the architect resolves hosting
  first. Full detail: `docs/architecture/CAMADA3_BACKUP_CONTRACT.md`.
- **`A3.4` (legacy user screen removal) — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17):**
  technical commit `32e466a` — `Remove legacy user screen`; architect
  ratification "ARCHITECT RATIFICATION — A3.4: ACCEPTED". **This closes
  `G28-CAMADA-2` — TRACK `COMPLETE` / `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` in staging**, full
  scope `A1-A7` + password policy (`A1`/`A7` satisfied by the pre-existing
  architecture; `A2.1`/`A2.1-B`/`A2.2`/`A2.3`, `A3.1`/`A3.2`/`A3.4`,
  `A4.1`/`A4.2`, `A5.1-A5.2`/`A5.3-A5.4`, `A6.1`/`A6.1-B`/`A6.2`/`A6.3` all
  `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`). **Reclassification history:** entered this work
  cycle as `PRE-EXISTING PARTIAL CAPABILITY + FULL SCOPE A1-A7 DEFERRED`
  (`G28-RECONCILIATION-DECISIONS-A`, 2026-07-15); exits `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`.
  `screenCadastrosUsuarios` (proven unreachable — zero production call
  sites repo-wide, route already cut over to `window.screenAdminUsuarios`
  since `A3.1`) and its 3 orphaned-only private helpers
  (`friendlyDisableMessage`, `friendlyDeleteMessage`,
  `setCadastrosModalFieldVisibility`) removed from
  `js/screens/cadastros.js` (2742→2184 lines); every helper shared with the
  file's other 6 screens kept untouched.
  `tests/cadastros-usuarios-auth-ui.smoke.js` deleted entirely (38 tests);
  3 sibling tests removed from `tests/admin-delete-user.smoke.js`, 4 from
  `tests/cadastros-screens.smoke.js` (7→6 telas counts corrected
  throughout); `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js` test 15 rewritten to assert
  the removal. Verification (isolated per-file, since full-suite parallel
  runs carry unrelated pre-existing flakiness here): exactly -45 tests (all
  intentional), -1 pre-existing failure eliminated (baked into the deleted
  file), zero new failures. **Resolved by deletion:** the `admin-create-user`
  invoke-envelope bug at the legacy `cadastros.js:2659` (identical to the
  already-fixed `UI-INVOKE-ENVELOPE-FIX`), the `checked: mostrarInativos`
  boolean-attribute bug at the legacy `:2348` (same class as
  `UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX`), and the `TEST-MOCK-FIDELITY-AUDIT` `R3`
  legacy-dead-code coverage gap. **Registered candidates (`NOT
  AUTHORIZED`):** `cadastrosModalGrid` (pre-existing dead helper, unrelated
  to this phase, folded into `CODE-HEALTH-AUDIT-§18-R1`); a second stale
  git-worktree metadata entry (`baseline-check-a34`, same OneDrive-lock
  class as `tapetes-baseline-check`). **Publication criterion status:**
  first half satisfied (`G28-CAMADA-2` `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` in staging) with
  two `PRE-PUBLICATION` asterisks that must close before production
  (`A2-SERVER-SIDE-ENFORCEMENT`, `A2-CREATE-NIVEL-ACESSO-WIRING`); second
  half (`G28-CAMADA-3`, automated backup) remains `NOT STARTED`, no spec.
  **Next authorizable action: `ARCHITECT DECISION`** — `G28-CAMADA-3`
  diagnosis (spec `BK1-BK8`), the two pre-publication asterisks, or
  `A6-GLOBAL-AUDIT-VIEW`/`AUDIT-ACTOR-SNAPSHOT`; no single unambiguous next
  technical phase.
- **`A2.2` (modal wiring) + `A2.3` (pilot route enforcement) — `CLOSED /
  ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17):** technical commit `09eb2a0` — `Wire admin access
  level into user admin`; architect visual gate `CONFIRMED`. Closes the
  `G28-CAMADA-2 / A2` track (`A2.1` + `A2.1-B` + `A2.2` + `A2.3`) as
  `COMPLETE`. `js/screens/admin-usuarios-modal.js` — "Nível de acesso" select,
  edit-only (hidden via `display:none` for fornecedor/cliente, same
  convention as `wrapperForn`/`wrapperCli`). **HARD STOP honored:**
  `admin-create-user`'s fixed-column `INSERT` never carried `nivel_acesso`,
  so the field is not rendered on create and never sent in the create
  payload — a new admin lands at the schema default (`completo`) and its
  level is set via a follow-up edit (`updateUsuario` is a raw PostgREST
  update, allowed by `is_admin()`-based RLS). Grid badge
  (`js/screens/admin-usuarios.js`): quiet `"Admin · leitura"` suffix for
  `somente_leitura`, plain `"Admin"` for `completo`. **A2.3 pilot = the
  users screen itself:** "Novo usuário" + all 4 row `actionButton()`s
  disabled with an explanatory title for an acting `somente_leitura` admin
  (derived from the already-fetched user list, no new query); every helper
  in `js/admin-usuarios-writes.js` also takes a trailing `readOnly` and
  refuses with `CLIENT_READONLY_FORBIDDEN` before touching `window.supa`.
  **Client-side only** — RLS/Edge Functions still key on `tipo='admin'`
  alone; a `somente_leitura` admin can bypass via direct API. Tests: +6 in
  `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js` (56/56), plus a `FakeNode` fidelity fix
  (`<select>.value` now follows a selected `<option>`, `.style` mirrored) in
  the same suite per `§20`. Full regression unchanged (138 pre-existing
  failures, identical before/after, zero new failures, +6 passing).
  **Registered candidates (`NOT AUTHORIZED`, both `PRE-PUBLICATION`):**
  `A2-SERVER-SIDE-ENFORCEMENT` (RLS/Edge Functions don't check
  `nivel_acesso`; `is_admin_full()` from `db/62` exists and is unused —
  required before trusting any real read-only admin in production);
  `A2-CREATE-NIVEL-ACESSO-WIRING` (admin-create-user's fixed column list
  drops the field; requires an Edge Function change). **Next authorizable
  action: `A3.4`** (legacy screen removal in `cadastros.js`), own order.
- **`A2.1` (nivel_acesso schema) + `A2.1-B` (ACL correction) — `CLOSED /
  ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17):** technical commit `f108c45`. `db/62` adds
  `public.usuarios.nivel_acesso` (`TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'completo'`, CHECK
  `completo`/`somente_leitura`; 10 existing users defaulted `completo`) and the
  `is_admin_full()` helper (`SECURITY DEFINER STABLE`; `ativo AND tipo='admin'
  AND nivel_acesso='completo'`). `usuarios.tipo` and `is_admin()` untouched.
  Applied+verified in staging (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`, registry
  `20260717093122 / 62_admin_nivel_acesso_schema`); role matrix all green
  including the critical regression (**`is_admin()` stays true for a
  `somente_leitura` admin**) and the `db/60` trigger recording a `nivel_acesso`
  change with correct payload. **Hard stop:** `db/62` left `service_role` with
  `EXECUTE` (Supabase default), diverging from the db/57 authenticated-only
  standard; architect ruled **Option 3** → grants-only `db/63` (registry
  `20260717101401 / 63_is_admin_full_grants`, precedent db/57), stating the
  complete intended ACL. **Final ACL verified: `EXECUTE` for `authenticated`
  only; PUBLIC/anon/service_role denied** (service_role runtime call → `42501`).
  **Next authorizable action: `A2.2` (modal wiring), own order** (`A2.3` route
  enforcement, `A3.4` legacy removal also own orders). Registered candidates
  (`NOT AUTHORIZED`): `IS-ADMIN-ACL-REVIEW` (the anchor `is_admin()` grants
  `EXECUTE` to PUBLIC/anon/authenticated/service_role — more permissive than the
  db/57 standard; tightening it touches every RLS policy → needs its own
  diagnosis) and the `tec-to-acabamento-flow` 2 stale static-slice assertions
  (same class as `L2`, trivial regex-anchor fix). Ledger closeout below.
- **`TEST-MOCK-FIDELITY-AUDIT` — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (read-only, architect
  ratification 2026-07-17):** all 124 `tests/` suites audited; **zero confirmed
  (c) structurally-blind doubles that mask a live bug** — the three triggering
  defects are fixed and their doubles corrected into the faithful seed. Report:
  `docs/reports/TEST_MOCK_FIDELITY_AUDIT_2026-07-17.md`. Substantive finding is
  structural (residual classes `R1`/`R2`/`R3`, see the report and
  `PROJECT_STATE.md`). Ratified: shared-double `tests/_doubles.js` APPROVED
  (additive, opt-in, phased, mandatory meta-tests); `§20` (test-double fidelity)
  added to `CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md`; the test-baseline "~87/11 failures" figures
  re-grounded and then RESOLVED. **`TEST-DOUBLE-SHARED-MODULE` Lot `L1` —
  `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`:** `tests/_doubles.js` + 16 meta-tests (`54ee8aa`);
  shared double adopted in **all 5** `R1` suites — 4 in `4d2f304`,
  `tec-to-acabamento-flow` in `520c9a6` — each +1 demonstration test; `R2` drift
  fixed (`fornecedor-screens`/`painel-screen`); `FaithfulNode` select→value
  reflection. No assertion weakened; `tec-to-acabamento-flow`'s 2 pre-existing
  static-slice failures preserved. **`TEST-DOUBLE-STALE-ASSERTION-CLEANUP`
  Lot `L2` — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`** (`2c9a4c2`): stale inline-`<script>`
  assertions in `index-inline`/`config`/`supabase-client` rewritten to the
  post-modularization structure (no inline script; module-content asserted; `?v=`
  tolerated; `js/boot.js` ordering boundary); `index-inline` fixed `:8765` →
  ephemeral `listen(0)`; `fornecedor-screens` menu-count made dynamic. All four
  green; the "~87/11 failures" baseline debt resolved. **`L3` `NO ACTION`**
  (subsumed by `A3.4`). **Read-only finding:** a stale git worktree registration
  `tapetes-baseline-check` (target missing on disk, `Permission denied` on
  auto-prune — likely OneDrive lock) — reported for authorized cleanup, NOT
  pruned. **Next authorizable action: `A2.1` (own order).** Registered follow-up
  (`NOT AUTHORIZED`): `tec-to-acabamento-flow`'s 2 false-red static-slice
  regexes. See the audit's dedicated section below.
- **PROJECT_STATE compaction (`PROJECT-STATE-COMPACTION-A`, 2026-07-16):** `PROJECT_STATE.md` is now current-state-only (active phase, binding decisions in force, live debts, environment, and a "Closed phases" index). Historical phase-closeout narratives were moved verbatim to `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md`. The "Full detail" pointers in this handoff now target that archive. This handoff itself was not compacted in that phase.
- **Staging-only execution boundary in force (`STAGING-ONLY-EXECUTION-BOUNDARY-A`, 2026-07-15):** explicit architect decision — the current operational environment is exclusively staging `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`; the protected/other Supabase project is out of scope; schema migration/promotion in production is postponed until the complete canonical backlog is finished; `DEPLOYMENT_MAPPING_AND_PRODUCTION_MIGRATION_PROCEDURE` is no longer a current material blocker, it is `DEFERRED UNTIL GLOBAL BACKLOG COMPLETION / NOT A CURRENT STAGING BLOCKER`; G28-D publication is `DEFERRED / NOT AUTHORIZED / NOT A CURRENT BLOCKER`; Vercel is a future candidate only, with no decision and no authorization. See `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` ("Architect Decision — Staging-Only Execution Boundary") and its own section below.
- **No active functional phase.** G28-C is reclassified (2026-07-15, `G28-RECONCILIATION-DECISIONS-A`) as `CLOSED / TECHNICALLY ACCEPTED — ARCHITECT PRODUCT VALIDATION PENDING` — see `PROJECT_STATE.md`. G28-D discovery remains `RELEASE CONTRACT DISCOVERY COMPLETE` (evidence preserved); its publication is `DEFERRED BY ARCHITECT / NOT A CURRENT BLOCKER / NOT AUTHORIZED` and does not constitute an active phase. The canonical definition of the publication mapping and of the authorized procedure for migrations 51/52 remains absent from the repository, but this is no longer a current blocker by explicit decision; see `docs/releases/G28_D_RELEASE_CANDIDATE.md`.
- **Last accepted phase:** `UI-INVOKE-ENVELOPE-FIX` — `Fix admin Edge Function response envelope unwrap — CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17; technical commit `7b37e8e`; architect-confirmed: reset shows the generated password, create-with-observações saves correctly — see its own section below). Surfaced by the `A6.3` visual gate; root cause pre-existing since `A5.1-A5.2`, not caused by `A6.2`. **`G28-CAMADA-2 / A6` track is now `COMPLETE`** (`A6.1` + `A6.1-B` + `A6.2` + `A6.3`, all `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`). `A6.3` — `Add user audit panel — CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17; technical commit `e31f269`; architect visual gate passed — see its own section below). `A6.2` — `Add audit trail writes to admin Edge Functions — CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17; technical commits `b67b126` + `7309349`; real E2E in staging `result: PASS`, `15/15` steps, `scripts/staging/usuarios-audit-e2e.mjs`, executed by the architect against the five functions the architect deployed — see its own section below). Standing on `A6.1-B` — `Preserve user audit events on profile deletion — CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-16; technical commit `fa8e1b9`; corrective migration over `db/60`, staging-verified — see its own section below), which resolved the FK HARD STOP discovered while first authorizing `A6.2`: `usuarios_eventos.usuario_id`'s `ON DELETE CASCADE` would have destroyed a delete's own audit event; now `ON DELETE SET NULL` + identity snapshot. Standing on `A6.1` — `Add user audit trail schema — CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-16; technical commit `ee0e77b`; schema/migration only, staging-verified role matrix, see its own section below). Prior to this: `UI-USERS-GRID-TEXT-OVERFLOW` — `Add text overflow ellipsis to users grid — CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-16; technical commit `3e95e86`; presentation-only, users grid only — see its own section below). Standing on `UI-ACTION-BUTTON-MIGRATION-2` (phase `iii`, lot `2` of the `UI-ACTION-BUTTON` track) — `Migrate users and ops screens to actionButton — CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-16; technical commit `abfb95e`; architect visual validation confirmed the users screen against the Clients reference — the original complaint's own test — plus a spot-check of `#/ops`). Includes the `ops-list.js` sr-only `display:none` a11y fix (now correct clip-rect) and the users-screen ACOES column-width fix (`102px`→`138px`, one grid-template value, per the architect's addendum). Phase `iii` lot `1` (`Migrate order lists to actionButton`, commit `31b66af`), phase `ii` (`Add actionButton primitive per visual contract`, commit `bbfd58c`) and phase `i` (contract amendment, §8.1 carve-out, commit `f30aa0d`) also `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. **Lot `3` (`cadastros.js`) remains `NOT AUTHORIZED`, pending its own order.** `UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX` (technical commit `8082428`) remains gated at `AGUARDANDO VALIDAÇÃO VISUAL DO ARQUITETO` — no explicit closeout order was issued for that fix specifically; not assumed closed. `G28-CAMADA-2 / A5.3-A5.4 — User Reactivation — CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-16; real e2e in staging `result: PASS`, 13/13 steps, executed by the architect via `scripts/staging/admin-reactivate-e2e.mjs`; architect visual validation confirmed the Desativar button works on an active user; see its own section below and `PROJECT_STATE.md`). The `A5` track (reset `A5.1-A5.2` + reactivation `A5.3-A5.4`) is now `COMPLETE`. `A5.1-A5.2` (administrative password reset), `A4.2` (mandatory password change guard) and `CAMADA2-LAST-ACCESS-UI` (consumption of RPC `db/59` in the UI, commit `0aff22f`) also `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-16). **No pending documentation closeout debt among these phases.** `CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-ACL-GRANTS-R1` remains `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-15). `G28-C` remains the last functional phase of G28 proper, now `CLOSED / TECHNICALLY ACCEPTED — ARCHITECT PRODUCT VALIDATION PENDING` (reclassification `G28-RECONCILIATION-DECISIONS-A`, 2026-07-15; staging/projections matrix 16/16 technical PASS; historical closeout `a7d7caa`/acceptance `d5ec09f` not rewritten; explicit debt `AUTHENTICATED_BROWSER_SMOKE_NOT_EXECUTED`). G28-B8 is `TECHNICALLY COMPLETED / ACCEPTANCE SUBSUMED BY G28-C`.
- **R1 commits completed:** `271761c3de20427b2cc9059d5ff7cc3727545e6d` — `G28: reconcile canonical phase state` (initial R1 documentation closeout); `edaf0b4d36f24aa7b9490e51a42624cc70d45963` — `G28: correct canonical reconciliation state` (correction of R1 textual defects). The current HEAD must be consulted directly with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Publication criterion (`G28-GOVERNANCE-CONSOLIDATION-A`, 2026-07-15):** binding architect decision — the system only enters production after `G28-CAMADA-2` (full scope `A1-A7`) and `G28-CAMADA-3` (automatic backup) are both `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` in staging. `PUBLICATION-TRACK-REVIEW` is a front conditioned on that criterion, not a current candidate. `G28-CAMADA-3` moves from deferred to `PUBLICATION CRITICAL PATH` (after Camada 2), pending its own spec (the `BK1-BK8` diagnosis is a future phase, `NOT AUTHORIZED`). Candidate front `CODE-HEALTH-AUDIT-§18-R1` (read-only §18 audit, input for decomposition of `cadastros.js`) also recorded `NOT AUTHORIZED`. See `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (its own section) and the section below.
- **Next action:** `CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-ACL-GRANTS-R1` was implemented, applied and verified in staging — **it must not be routed again** as the next action; it is `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. The read-only reconciliation of the general backlog (`BACKLOG-RECONCILIATION-READONLY-R1`), the documentation backfill `DOCS-CANONICAL-CONSISTENCY-BACKFILL-A` and the recording of the boundary `STAGING-ONLY-EXECUTION-BOUNDARY-A` have also already been completed. **Next front selected:** `G28-CAMADA-2`. The proposed spec was materialized in `docs/architecture/CAMADA2_USUARIOS_SPEC_PROPOSED.md` (`CAMADA2-USUARIOS-SPEC-MATERIALIZE-R1`). `A3.1` (1:1 extraction of the users screen), `A3.2` (summary cards + toolbar), `A4.1` + `CAMADA2-LAST-ACCESS-RPC`, `CAMADA2-LAST-ACCESS-UI`, `A4.2` (mandatory password change guard), `A5.1-A5.2` (administrative password reset) and `A5.3-A5.4` (user reactivation) are all `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` — see their own sections below. **None of these must be routed again as the next action.** The full `A5` track (reset + reactivation) is now `COMPLETE`. **Next authorizable action (2026-07-17, updated at the consolidated `A6`/`UI-INVOKE-ENVELOPE-FIX` closeout): `ARCHITECT DECISION` on a read-only front.** `TEST-MOCK-FIDELITY-AUDIT` is **promoted to priority candidate**: three defects from the same root class surfaced in one day — `UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX` (severity **CONFIRMED — ACTIVE REGRESSION** since the `A5.3-A5.4` closeout — `el()`'s unconditional `setAttribute`, real DOM behavior not modeled by test `FakeNode`s; the Excluir button in `admin-usuarios.js` carries the identical vulnerable `disabled: <boolean>` pattern and is unconfirmed but suspect), hand-mocked `js/ui.js` primitives in suites that build their own DOM stand-ins, and `UI-INVOKE-ENVELOPE-FIX`'s fake-`invoke()` mock (flat payload, one level shallower than the real client) — each a test double diverging from the real behavior it imitates, letting a live bug through. Scope: inventory every such test double in `tests/`, read-only, no code fix bundled. `A2.1` (schema `nivel_acesso`) and `A3.4` (legacy code removal in `cadastros.js`, unlocks once `A2`/`A6` subphases close — now `A6` is fully closed) are the next authorizable **technical** candidates after that audit. No subphase authorized by this record. The project's supervision protocol is formalized in `docs/governance/SUPERVISION_PROTOCOL.md` (Architect/Reviewer/Resident Executor roles). Hygiene of the `work/app-next` worktree (divergent/dirty) remains authorized as a parallel read-only task in a separate order. `OPEN_ARCHITECT_DECISIONS: NONE` for the current staging cycle. Remaining Client Portal debts are made explicit: `DB30_NOT_RECORDED_IN_SUPABASE_MIGRATION_HISTORY` and `AUTHENTICATED_BROWSER_SMOKE_NOT_EXECUTED`. Recorded baseline/decomposition debts: 6 tests in `tests/auth.smoke.js` with outdated regex (`A4.2`) and `js/screens/admin-usuarios-modal.js` at 604 lines (grew from 576 at `A5.1-A5.2`, unchanged candidate for `CODE-HEALTH-AUDIT-§18-R1`, no action taken). Publication is not the next action and no automatic implementation follows.
- **Workspace / branch / previous HEAD:** `D:\OneDrive\Programação\Ravatex\controle-tapetes-g28` / `work/g28-document-qualification`. Previous technical/documentation HEAD: `b27e79fdba1ed8fb8a6232d8e0b8ca4b37ac3a2c` (historical G28-D discovery baseline; this documentation record succeeds it).
- **Mandatory reading before routing any order:** `PROJECT_STATE.md`, this handoff, G28 master plan (`docs/architecture/DOCUMENTOS_VALIDACAO_VINCULOS_E_EVOLUCAO_PLANO.md`), `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_PRODUCTION_FLOW_BACKLOG.md`, G28 ledger (`docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md`) and applicable contracts/runtime.
- **Documentation continuity — mandatory paths:**
  1. `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_MOVIMENTACAO_DOCUMENTOS_PLANO.md`
  2. `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_PRODUCTION_FLOW_BACKLOG.md`
  3. `docs/architecture/DOCUMENTOS_VALIDACAO_VINCULOS_E_EVOLUCAO_PLANO.md`
  4. `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_SCHEMA_CONTRACT.md`
  5. `PROJECT_STATE.md`
  6. `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
  7. `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md`
  8. `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`
  9. `docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md`
  Every future handoff must relay these paths and expressly instruct the next chat to relay them again in any subsequent handoff. The continuity chain of the plan and of the backlog cannot be interrupted.
- **Runtime boundaries:** Document→Pedido 0..1 and Document→OP 0..N contract; dedicated revision tables; Ingestor retains candidate/event fields; B5 preserved; no `statusOverrides`, dual write, backfill or production.
- **Non-blocking debt:** `AUTHENTICATED_BROWSER_SMOKE_BLOCKED_BY_TOOLING` (the browser has no staging admin application/session).

## Test Mock Fidelity Audit — TEST-MOCK-FIDELITY-AUDIT — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Phase:** `TEST-MOCK-FIDELITY-AUDIT` (read-only). **Documentation commit:**
  this closeout (`Record test mock fidelity audit`; docs-only — no code, test,
  SQL, migration, Supabase, staging, production or Vercel accessed/changed). The
  current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Authorization:** explicit architect order ("ARCHITECT AUTHORIZATION —
  TEST-MOCK-FIDELITY-AUDIT (read-only)"), session model / high effort; ratified
  by the architect on 2026-07-17.
- **Result:** all 124 `tests/` suites inventoried and classified against the
  real behavior each double imitates (`js/ui.js` `el()` boolean coercion,
  `functions.invoke()` double envelope, `.rpc()`/PostgREST `{data,error}`, real
  ui.js primitives). **Zero confirmed (c) structurally-blind doubles that mask a
  live bug.** The three triggering defects were genuine (c) at the time and are
  fixed with their doubles corrected into the faithful seed; only
  `admin-usuarios.smoke.js` runtime-fakes `functions.invoke` and it is faithful.
- **Substantive finding (structural):** fidelity is accidental/per-suite — `R1`
  quarantined boolean-blind hand-mock `el()` (`direct-cnpj-screens`,
  `pedido-form`, `cliente-pedido-tracking`, `pedido-detail-linked-documents`,
  `tec-to-acabamento-flow`), `R2` fail-unsafe raw-store `FakeNode` copy-drift
  (`fornecedor-screens`, `painel-screen`), `R3` legacy-dead-code invoke coverage
  gap (resolved by `A3.4`).
- **Ratified rulings:** shared-double `tests/_doubles.js` `APPROVED as proposed`
  (additive, opt-in, phased, mandatory meta-tests, seeded from the three
  corrected doubles); `§20` (test-double fidelity) added to
  `CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md`; lots `L1` (shared module + `R1` adoption + `R2` fix)
  and `L2` (stale inline-`<script>` cleanup) `AUTHORIZED`; `L3` `NO ACTION`.
- **Report:** `docs/reports/TEST_MOCK_FIDELITY_AUDIT_2026-07-17.md` (full
  per-suite verdicts, evidence, shared-double assessment, prioritized lots,
  known-debt classification).
- **Accesses:** no Supabase/MCP/staging/production/Vercel; `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew`
  not accessed; no push.
- **Next authorizable action:** Lot `L1` (`TEST-DOUBLE-SHARED-MODULE`), then
  `L2`, then `A2.1`/`A3.4`.
- **Full detail:** `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).

## Controlled Delete × Document History (Pedido/OP) — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `707a37bd1d2c4728ab2a17433b6441049bd88062` — `Guard controlled delete against document link history` (`js/delete-helpers.js`, `tests/controlled-delete.smoke.js`, `db/53`–`db/56`).
- **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close controlled delete document history guard`). The current HEAD must be consulted directly with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Original problem:** controlled physical deletion of Pedido/OP (`db/34`–`db/37`) violated the FK `document_link_revision_ops_op_id_fkey` when attempting to remove an OP still referenced by canonical append-only document history.
- **Root cause and fixes:** `db/53` adds a documentation guard via `SECURITY DEFINER` wrappers that block physical deletion when there is canonical history (`document_link_revisions`/`document_link_revision_ops`), renaming the legacy destructive logic to `*_pre53` (externally inaccessible); `db/54` fixes an emergency security finding (`anon_execute = true` on the public RPCs), restricting `EXECUTE` to `authenticated`; `db/55` fixes `to_jsonb(<literal>)` without an explicit cast (`could not determine polymorphic type`) via a forward-only patch; `db/56` fixes a `jsonb_set` `STRICT` regression that collapsed the diagnosis to `NULL` on eligible targets, using `COALESCE(to_jsonb(v_reason), 'null'::jsonb)`.
- **Local tests:** `node --check js/delete-helpers.js` PASS; `tests/controlled-delete.smoke.js` **53/53**; `tests/document-canonical-links-contract.test.js` **21/21**; `git diff --check` PASS.
- **Staging smokes (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`, synthetic fixtures, zero cleanup):** Case A1 (eligible OP with dependency, no history) — non-null diagnosis, removal completed; Case A2 (eligible Pedido with dependency, no history) — non-null diagnosis, removal completed; Case B (with document history) — diagnosis blocked, `remover_op`/`remover_pedido` blocked in a controlled manner, all document history preserved without change. `op_numeros` preserved in all cases.
- **Final ACL (verified against the live catalog):** the 4 public RPCs — `authenticated`-only (`PUBLIC`/`anon` without `EXECUTE`); the 4 `*_pre53` functions — `postgres`-only (`PUBLIC`/`anon`/`authenticated` without `EXECUTE`).
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked.
- **Next authorizable action (per `PROJECT_STATE.md`):** `ARCHITECT DECISION REQUIRED AFTER BACKLOG RECONCILIATION`.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Controlled Delete × Document History") and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).

## Admin/Pedido — Static Residue of the Completion Button (Expedição) — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `7978e0a4fe021467cc23e0aeed63ac87ba738f1b` — `Fix admin order completion button state` (`js/screens/expedicao-admin.js`, `tests/expedicao-flow.smoke.js`).
- **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close admin order completion button residue`). The current HEAD must be consulted directly with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Original problem:** `js/screens/expedicao-admin.js:405` built `disabled: ready ? null : 'disabled'`; the shared helper `js/ui.js` `el()` calls `setAttribute(k, v)` for every attribute without omitting `null`, materializing `disabled="null"` in the real DOM — a boolean attribute present, disabling the "Concluir pedido" button even when `ready === true`.
- **Root cause and fix:** single occurrence in the repository; fix localized entirely at the call site (`buildConclusao`), without altering `js/ui.js`. `buttonAttrs` built as a variable before the `return`; `disabled` only enters the object when `!ready`. `onclick`, text, styles and structure preserved without semantic change.
- **Local tests:** `node --check js/screens/expedicao-admin.js` PASS; `tests/expedicao-flow.smoke.js` **9/9**; `tests/expedicao-partial-flow.smoke.js` **12/12**; `git diff --check` PASS.
- **Accesses:** no staging; no production (`bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed); no push.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked.
- **Next authorizable action:** `CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-APPLY-STAGING-A` — `READY FOR EXPLICIT ARCHITECT AUTHORIZATION` / `NOT STARTED`. This entry does not authorize its execution.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Admin/Pedido — Static Residue of the Completion Button") and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).

## Client Portal — Order Detail Read Model — CLOSED / ACCEPTED_WITH_NONBLOCKING_DEBTS

- **Phase:** `CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-APPLY-STAGING-A`. **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close client order summary read model staging validation`). No technical commit — the phase changed no files (verification-only). The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Result:** `db/30_cliente_pedido_summary_readmodel.sql` **was already applied** in staging (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`); the function `public.cliente_pedido_summary(uuid)` exists with a body byte-for-byte equivalent to `db/30` (**no drift**), signature/`SECURITY DEFINER`/`STABLE`/`search_path=public`/owner `postgres` per contract; the 16 dependency tables exist.
- **Contract validated:** real RPC called per role — owner client `ok=true` (full DTO), `anon` `ok=false` **fail-closed** (executes, no data), cross-tenant `ok=false`, admin `ok=true`. All fields consumed by `js/screens/cliente-pedido-detail.js` present and typed; empty collections `[]`; nulls handled; no dependence on silent fallback.
- **Divergences recorded (not normalized):** the live ACL grants `EXECUTE` to `PUBLIC`/`anon`/`authenticated`/`service_role` (`db/30` intends only `authenticated`); `db/30` not recorded in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations`.
- **Non-blocking debts:** `ACL_GRANTS_BROADER_THAN_CANONICAL_CONTRACT` (anon fail-closed, no confirmed exposure); `DB30_NOT_RECORDED_IN_SUPABASE_MIGRATION_HISTORY`; `AUTHENTICATED_BROWSER_SMOKE_NOT_EXECUTED` (no test client password).
- **Remediation candidate (not authorized, not started):** `CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-ACL-GRANTS-R1` — `ARCHITECT DECISION REQUIRED`; intended scope = grants-only migration analogous to `db/54` (`REVOKE EXECUTE … FROM PUBLIC, anon`, preserving `authenticated`).
- **Accesses:** Supabase MCP not exposed in the session; the authorized direct PostgreSQL fallback used only for verification (read-only, `BEGIN … ROLLBACK`, zero mutation); temporary tooling outside the repo removed; no secret echoed. Production (`bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew`) not accessed; no push.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked.
- **Next authorizable action:** `ARCHITECT DECISION REQUIRED AFTER BACKLOG RECONCILIATION` — no single unambiguous next action; the ACL remediation candidate must not be self-selected.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Client Portal — Order Detail Read Model") and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).

## Canonical Documentation — Consistency Backfill — DOCS-CANONICAL-CONSISTENCY-BACKFILL-A — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Phase:** `DOCS-CANONICAL-CONSISTENCY-BACKFILL-A`. **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Backfill canonical migration documentation`). Docs-only — no code, test, SQL, migration, staging or production changed. The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Gaps closed:** (1) `db/37_controlled_delete_expedicao_cascade.sql` without its own `D-DEL` entry — added `D-DEL14` in `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_SCHEMA_CONTRACT.md` §10; (2) `db/34`–`db/37` and `db/53`–`db/56` absent from `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` §4 — 8 lines added; (3) status of `db/30` in the index, corrected from "not yet applied" to applied/verified in staging with a broader ACL than the canonical contract retained as an explicit debt.
- **Debts preserved as open (not closed by this backfill):** `CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-ACL-GRANTS-R1`; `DB30_NOT_RECORDED_IN_SUPABASE_MIGRATION_HISTORY`; authenticated smoke debts (G28-C/D/B7/Client Portal); `DEPLOYMENT_MAPPING_AND_PRODUCTION_MIGRATION_PROCEDURE`; `G28-D`; production application of the staging-only stack; `DELETE-PROD-GUARD-A`; `DELETE-AUDIT-LOG-A`; `G28-CAMADA-2/3/4`.
- **Accesses:** no staging; no production (`bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed); no push.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked.
- **Next authorizable action:** `ARCHITECT DECISION REQUIRED` — `DEPLOYMENT_MAPPING_AND_PRODUCTION_MIGRATION_PROCEDURE`. This backfill does not authorize any technical phase.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Canonical Documentation — Consistency Backfill") and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).
- **Mandatory documentation continuity — relay in every future handoff:**
  1. `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_MOVIMENTACAO_DOCUMENTOS_PLANO.md`
  2. `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_PRODUCTION_FLOW_BACKLOG.md`
  3. `docs/architecture/DOCUMENTOS_VALIDACAO_VINCULOS_E_EVOLUCAO_PLANO.md`
  4. `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_SCHEMA_CONTRACT.md`
  5. `PROJECT_STATE.md`
  6. `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`
  7. `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md`
  8. `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`
  9. `docs/governance/DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md`
  Every future chat or agent must relay these nine paths and expressly instruct the next continuity to relay them again. The continuity chain of the plan and of the backlog cannot be interrupted.

## Architect Decision — Staging-Only Execution Boundary — STAGING-ONLY-EXECUTION-BOUNDARY-A

*(translated from the architect's original Portuguese; original in docs/archive/pt-BR/)*

- **Phase:** `STAGING-ONLY-EXECUTION-BOUNDARY-A`. **Documentation commit:** this record (`Record staging-only execution boundary`). Docs-only — no code, test, SQL, migration, Supabase, staging, production or Vercel accessed/changed. The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Binding decision recorded:** the current operational environment is exclusively staging `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`; the protected/other Supabase project is out of scope; schema migration/promotion in production postponed until the complete canonical backlog is finished; a production publication mapping is not required for the current work in staging; publication of G28-D remains postponed, not authorized and does not constitute a current blocker; the publication provider (incl. Vercel) is not selected — a future candidate only.
- **Reclassification:** `DEPLOYMENT_MAPPING_AND_PRODUCTION_MIGRATION_PROCEDURE` is no longer recorded as a current material blocker or a required next architect decision; it becomes `DEFERRED BY ARCHITECT UNTIL GLOBAL BACKLOG COMPLETION / NOT A CURRENT STAGING BLOCKER / NOT STARTED`. It was not discovered, defined, tested or finished — only intentionally postponed. Discovery evidence preserved, not rewritten, in `docs/releases/G28_D_RELEASE_CANDIDATE.md`.
- **Next technical candidate:** `CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-ACL-GRANTS-R1` was authorized, implemented, applied and verified in staging on 2026-07-15 (`CLOSED / ACCEPTED` — see its own section below). There is no single subsequent technical candidate; `NEXT_AUTHORIZABLE_ACTION: NONE`.

## Architect Decision — Backlog Reconciliation and Supervision Governance — G28-RECONCILIATION-DECISIONS-A

*(translated from the architect's original Portuguese; original in docs/archive/pt-BR/)*

- **Phase:** `G28-RECONCILIATION-DECISIONS-A`. **Documentation commit:** this record (`Record architect reconciliation decisions`). Docs-only — no code, test, SQL, migration, Supabase, staging, production or Vercel accessed/changed. The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Read-only baseline underpinning this decision:** `BACKLOG-RECONCILIATION-READONLY-R1` (`docs/reports/BACKLOG_RECONCILIATION_R1_2026-07-15.md`), executed after reading the 9 canonical paths + the ChatGPT closeout (`docs/handoffs/CHATGPT_CLOSEOUT_2026-07-15.md`).
- **`PROJECT-CONTROL-BASELINE-R1` (ChatGPT):** `REJECTED / NOT RATIFIED` — materially incorrect classification of Camada 2 (treated partial capability as accepted implementation). External artifact, never canonical. Its proposed correction (`PROJECT-CONTROL-BASELINE-R1-CORRECTION`) is `CANCELLED / ABSORBED / SUPERSEDED` by the diagnosis `BACKLOG-RECONCILIATION-READONLY-R1`, adopted as the current reference baseline.
- **G28-CAMADA-2 reclassified:** `PRE-EXISTING PARTIAL CAPABILITY` (user CRUD, deactivation/ban via Edge Functions, single role `usuarios.tipo`, client/supplier link — a byproduct of `AUTH-DISABLE-USER` and of the Client Portal) `+ FULL SCOPE A1-A7 DEFERRED` (password reset/recovery, invitations, roles/permissions matrix, full audit, full password policy, reactivation — none of these found in the real code). Not accepted as a dedicated phase; no implementation authorized by this record. Functional/visual reference for the full scope, when authorized: `D:\OneDrive\Programação\SGAA_clean_baseline`.
- **G28-C reclassified in the current state:** `CLOSED / TECHNICALLY ACCEPTED — ARCHITECT PRODUCT VALIDATION PENDING`, separating technical/staging acceptance (16/16 matrix, migrations applied/verified) from the architect's functional/personal validation (not recorded) and from the authenticated browser smoke (`AUTHENTICATED_BROWSER_SMOKE_NOT_EXECUTED`, never executed). The historical closeout (`a7d7caa`/acceptance `d5ec09f`) **is not rewritten**; this is a new and linked entry in the G28 ledger.
- **Supervision governance:** tracking of progress, continuity, scope, authorizations, phases and documentation passes to Claude (chat) and Claude Code (resident). ChatGPT remains available as a process consultant, **with no custody of state and no authority to issue orders**.
- **Next front selected:** `G28-CAMADA-2`, starting with a comparative read-only diagnosis in a subsequent order of its own — **not authorized by this record**.
- **Authorized parallel task:** hygiene of the `work/app-next` worktree (11 commits behind `staging/work/app-next`, dirty worktree) — **read-only**, separate order.
- **Accesses:** no Supabase/MCP/staging/production/Vercel access in this phase; no push.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Architect Decision — Backlog Reconciliation and Supervision Governance") and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).
- **Mandatory documentation continuity — relay in every future handoff:**

## Camada 2 — User Administration — Proposed Spec — CAMADA2-USUARIOS-SPEC-MATERIALIZE-R1

- **Phase:** `CAMADA2-USUARIOS-SPEC-MATERIALIZE-R1`. **Documentation commit:** this record (`Add Camada 2 user administration spec`). Docs-only — no code, test, SQL, migration, Supabase, staging, production or Vercel accessed/changed. **Status: `PROPOSED`.** The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Document created:** `docs/architecture/CAMADA2_USUARIOS_SPEC_PROPOSED.md`. Mandatory reading before routing any order on `G28-CAMADA-2`.
- **Content:** `A1-A7` + password policy, each item with file:line evidence of what SGAA_clean_baseline does (external read-only reference), what already exists in Tapetes, what is missing, an adapted proposal, foreseen modules/files, Auth risk and subphase/gate. Includes a consolidated module plan, an Auth risk table and the order of subphases.
- **Architect decisions already incorporated (do not reopen without a new decision):** `nivel_acesso` 2 levels (`completo`/`somente_leitura`); permissions override table not built; A4 = temporary-password-with-forced-change only, email/SMTP `NOT AUTHORIZED`; bulk actions (A3.3) `DEFERRED`; explicit session revocation out of scope.
- **Next authorizable action:** `A3.1` was authorized, executed and accepted — see the section "Camada 2 — User Screen Extraction" below. The next subphase is `A3.2`, under a mockup gate.
- **Accesses:** no Supabase/MCP/staging/production/Vercel access; strictly read-only reading of `D:\OneDrive\Programação\SGAA_clean_baseline` (unrelated external project, no file touched); no push.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Camada 2 — User Administration — Proposed Spec") and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).

## Camada 2 — User Screen Extraction — CAMADA2-USUARIOS-A3-1 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `4f01101143a512c8018d58ce9e523064c38a145f` — `Extract user administration screen modules` (`js/admin-usuarios-writes.js`, `js/screens/admin-usuarios-modal.js`, `js/screens/admin-usuarios.js`, `index.html`, `js/boot.js`, `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js`, `tests/boot.smoke.js`, `tests/cadastros-screens.smoke.js`).
- **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close Camada 2 user administration screen extraction`). The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Scope:** pure refactor — 1:1 extraction of `screenCadastrosUsuarios` (`js/screens/cadastros.js:2226-2713`) into 3 own modules, no new feature, no behavior change. Route cutover brought forward (spec revision adjustment): `js/boot.js` rewired to `window.screenAdminUsuarios`; `index.html` with the 3 new scripts.
- **Coupling resolved:** form helpers from `cadastros.js` (IIFE, not exposed on `window.*`) duplicated locally in `admin-usuarios-modal.js` — identical behavior, without touching `cadastros.js`.
- **Scope decision:** the original `render()` function (dead code, never called) not ported — no observable impact.
- **Not changed:** `cadastros.js`, `js/ui.js`, `js/auth.js` untouched. `screenCadastrosUsuarios` remains in `cadastros.js` until isolated removal in `A3.4`.
- **Tests:** `admin-usuarios.smoke.js` (new) 13/13; `boot.smoke.js` 32/32; `cadastros-screens.smoke.js` 32/32; broad regression of 28 suites: 1207/1296, identical to the baseline (`git stash` compared). `git diff --check` clean.
- **Visual validation:** confirmed by the architect on the route `#/cadastros/usuarios`, local app (`http://localhost:8765`) pointing to staging `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo` — 1:1 parity accepted.
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked.
- **Next authorizable action:** `A3.2` was authorized and completed — see its own section below.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Camada 2 — User Screen Extraction"), `docs/refactor/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_LEDGER.md` (§4/§6) and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).

## Camada 2 — Summary Cards and Toolbar — CAMADA2-USUARIOS-A3-2 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commits:** `b4a6238c34afb683ec7a973d230330b7266c99f2` — `Add user admin summary cards and toolbar`; `3198570c04b08bef83605f64bc9ae1c5ece8b873` — `Align summary card background with dashboard`.
- **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close user admin summary cards phase`). The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Scope:** additive UI feature over `js/screens/admin-usuarios.js` (extracted in `A3.1`) — summary cards (4, KPI), toolbar (search+sort+type filter+toggle), colored role badge, inactive-row opacity. Mockup gate satisfied (approved by the architect on 2026-07-15); final values in `docs/design/CAMADA2_A32_MOCKUP_APPROVED.md`.
- **Item 4 blocked (HARD STOP confirmed, not implemented):** the "Último acesso" column requires reading `auth.users.last_sign_in_at`, nonexistent today (no RPC/view exposes it). **Architect decision: admin-only `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC, `is_admin()` pattern.** Recorded `CAMADA2-LAST-ACCESS-RPC` — `NOT AUTHORIZED`, candidate to group with the `A4.1` migration.
- **Post-validation adjustment:** card background standard `#f4f6f9` → `#fff` (same tone as `.rv-adm-card` in `js/screens/painel.js`); Inactive card keeps `#fff8f8`.
- **Not changed:** `index.html` (no new script); `js/admin-usuarios-writes.js`; `js/screens/admin-usuarios-modal.js`; `cadastros.js`; `js/ui.js`; `js/auth.js`. `docs/refactor/ARCHITECTURE_REFACTOR_LEDGER.md` received no entry (no new module/route change).
- **Tests:** `admin-usuarios.smoke.js` 20/20 (7 new); `boot.smoke.js` + `cadastros-screens.smoke.js` 64/64 (no regression); `git diff --check` clean.
- **Visual validation:** confirmed by the architect on the route `#/cadastros/usuarios`, local app (`http://localhost:8765`) pointing to staging `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`, including the background adjustment.
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked.
- **Governance:** supervision protocol formalized in `docs/governance/SUPERVISION_PROTOCOL.md` in this phase (Architect/Reviewer/Resident Executor roles, onboarding, order format, gates).
- **Next authorizable action:** `ARCHITECT DECISION REQUIRED` among `A4.1`, `A2.1`, `A6.1` (see the section above). `A3.3` `DEFERRED`. `A3.4` depends on the other A3.x subphases. This entry does not authorize its execution.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Camada 2 — Summary Cards and Toolbar") and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).

## Client Portal — ACL Grants Hardening — CLIENTE-ORDER-SUMMARY-READMODEL-ACL-GRANTS-R1 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `82f5ba70ace2e74c51b7c0295d1ecf8e319954be` — `Restrict client order summary RPC grants` (`db/57_cliente_pedido_summary_acl_grants.sql`, `tests/cliente-pedido-summary-acl-grants.smoke.js`). **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close client order summary RPC grant hardening`). The current HEAD must be consulted directly with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Original problem:** the live ACL of `public.cliente_pedido_summary(uuid)` in staging granted `EXECUTE` also to `PUBLIC`, `anon` and `service_role`, besides `authenticated`, diverging from the canonical contract `D-COS02` (`authenticated`-only).
- **Fix:** `db/57` grants-only, forward-only, idempotent, restricted to the exact signature of the function — `REVOKE EXECUTE ... FROM PUBLIC, anon, service_role; GRANT EXECUTE ... TO authenticated`. Applied exactly once via Supabase MCP (tracked migration operation) in staging `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`; record `20260715190627 / 57_cliente_pedido_summary_acl_grants` confirmed.
- **Final ACL:** `PUBLIC` without `EXECUTE`; `anon` without `EXECUTE`; `authenticated` with `EXECUTE`; `service_role` without explicit `EXECUTE`. Owner `postgres` retains inherent privilege.
- **Function contract unchanged:** signature, return `jsonb`, `SECURITY DEFINER`, `STABLE`, `search_path=public`, owner `postgres`, body — definition hash identical before/after.
- **Empirical matrix (staging, read-only, `BEGIN … ROLLBACK`, no fixtures):** `anon` → `ERROR 42501: permission denied` at the ACL boundary before execution; `authenticated` owner → `ok=true` full DTO; `authenticated` cross-tenant → `ok=false` fail-closed with no third-party data; `authenticated` admin → `ok=true` full DTO; `service_role` via direct `SET ROLE` → `ERROR 42501` (object grant successfully revoked; `rolbypassrls` is a distinct RLS mechanism, it does not restore `EXECUTE`).
- **Frontend:** `js/screens/cliente-pedido-detail.js` remains the only real consumer (standard authenticated path); no change needed.
- **Local tests:** `tests/cliente-pedido-summary-acl-grants.smoke.js` (new) + `tests/cliente-pedido-summary-readmodel.smoke.js` (existing) — **21/21 PASS**; `git diff --check` clean.
- **Debt closed:** `ACL_GRANTS_BROADER_THAN_CANONICAL_CONTRACT` — `RESOLVED IN STAGING`.
- **Debts preserved as open:** `DB30_NOT_RECORDED_IN_SUPABASE_MIGRATION_HISTORY` (no history record fabricated for `db/30`); `AUTHENTICATED_BROWSER_SMOKE_NOT_EXECUTED`; production application of the staging-only stack (incl. `db/57`) remains postponed by `STAGING-ONLY-EXECUTION-BOUNDARY-A`.
- **Accesses:** Supabase MCP connected and used only for catalog reading and the tracked application of the migration in staging `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`; production (`bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew`) not accessed; Vercel not accessed; no push.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked.
- **Next authorizable action:** `ARCHITECT DECISION REQUIRED AFTER BACKLOG RECONCILIATION` — `NEXT_AUTHORIZABLE_ACTION: NONE` until a new reconciliation of the remaining general backlog.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Client Portal — ACL Grants Hardening") and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).

## Canonical Documentation — Status Consistency of the Legacy Pedido↔OP Plans — DOCS-PEDIDO-OP-LEGACY-PLAN-STATUS-CONSISTENCY-R1 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Phase:** `DOCS-PEDIDO-OP-LEGACY-PLAN-STATUS-CONSISTENCY-R1`. **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Reconcile legacy Pedido OP plan phase statuses`). Docs-only — no code, runtime, test, SQL, migration, Supabase, MCP, staging, production or Vercel accessed/changed. The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Fix:** the current status lines of legacy Phases D–J were reconciled in `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_SCHEMA_CONTRACT.md` §9 and `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_MOVIMENTACAO_DOCUMENTOS_PLANO.md` §5.
- **Mandatory routing for the next agent:** legacy Phases **D, E, F** were **delivered** through the accepted production-flow work and must **not** be routed as open implementation phases. Legacy Phases **G, H, I** were **superseded** by the canonical G28 documentation pipeline (`document_link_revisions`/`document_link_revision_ops`; `documentos_operacionais` never created) and also must **not** be routed as open phases. **Phase J** remains exclusively as `FUTURE / UNSEQUENCED / NOT STARTED / NOT AUTHORIZED`.
- **State unchanged:** `ACTIVE_PHASE: NONE`; `NEXT_AUTHORIZABLE_ACTION: NONE` pending explicit architect selection. All open debts and deferred fronts remain unchanged (`DB30_NOT_RECORDED_IN_SUPABASE_MIGRATION_HISTORY`, `AUTHENTICATED_BROWSER_SMOKE_NOT_EXECUTED`, production application of the staging-only stack, `DEPLOYMENT_MAPPING_AND_PRODUCTION_MIGRATION_PROCEDURE`, G28-D/Vercel, `DELETE-PROD-GUARD-A`, `DELETE-AUDIT-LOG-A`, `G28-CAMADA-2/3/4`).
- **Accesses:** no staging; no production (`bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed); no Supabase/MCP; no Vercel; no push.

## Architect Decision — Publication Criterion and Candidate Fronts — G28-GOVERNANCE-CONSOLIDATION-A — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

*(translated from the architect's original Portuguese; original in docs/archive/pt-BR/)*

- **Phase:** `G28-GOVERNANCE-CONSOLIDATION-A`. **Documentation commit:** this record (`Consolidate supervision protocol and register publication criteria`). Docs-only — no code, test, SQL, migration, Supabase, staging, production or Vercel accessed/changed. The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Supervision protocol:** `docs/governance/SUPERVISION_PROTOCOL.md` received an appendix "Supervision handoff — standard block" (verbatim text from the architect, to open any new reviewer/supervisor session) and now requires a `STRUCTURAL POLICY COMPLIANCE` section in the report format of every implementation phase (applicable rules of `docs/architecture/CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md` cited + evidence + line size of the touched files).
- **Candidate fronts recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.md`:** `CODE-HEALTH-AUDIT-§18-R1` (read-only post-Camada 2 audit, §18 of `CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md`, input for the incremental decomposition of `cadastros.js` and triage of test debts) — `NOT AUTHORIZED`; `PUBLICATION-TRACK-REVIEW` (staging-only boundary + `DEPLOYMENT_MAPPING_AND_PRODUCTION_MIGRATION_PROCEDURE` + G28-D + production application of the staging-only migrations + `DELETE-PROD-GUARD-A`) — `NOT AUTHORIZED / CONDITIONED`.
- **Binding architect decision — publication criterion (2026-07-15):** the system only enters production after `G28-CAMADA-2` (full scope `A1-A7`) and `G28-CAMADA-3` (automatic backup) are both `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` in staging. `PUBLICATION-TRACK-REVIEW` is conditioned on that criterion, is not a current candidate even after reconciliation of the general backlog. The `STAGING-ONLY-EXECUTION-BOUNDARY-A` boundary remains in force unchanged.
- **Recorded consequence:** `G28-CAMADA-3` moves from a deferred front to `PUBLICATION CRITICAL PATH` (after `G28-CAMADA-2`), pending its own spec; the `BK1-BK8` diagnosis is a future phase, `NOT AUTHORIZED` by this record.
- **Not changed:** no code, test, SQL, migration, runtime touched; no subphase of `G28-CAMADA-2`/`G28-CAMADA-3` authorized; `STAGING-ONLY-EXECUTION-BOUNDARY-A` not rewritten, only referenced as unchanged.
- **Accesses:** no staging; no production (`bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed); no Supabase/MCP; no Vercel; no push.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; selective staging by literal path; zero untracked after the commit.
- **Next authorizable action:** unchanged — `ARCHITECT DECISION REQUIRED AFTER BACKLOG RECONCILIATION` among `A4.1`, `A2.1`, `A6.1` of `G28-CAMADA-2` (see their own sections above). This record does not authorize any subphase.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Architect Decision — Publication Criterion and Candidate Fronts") and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).
- **Mandatory documentation continuity — relay in every future handoff:**

- **Schema/RPC applied and verified in staging (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`), via Supabase MCP:** `db/58` (record `20260716014338`) adds `usuarios.senha_temporaria`/`usuarios.senha_gerada_em`, with no retroactive effect on the 10 existing users; `db/59` (record `20260716014358`) creates `public.admin_usuarios_last_sign_in()` — `SECURITY DEFINER`/`STABLE`, `is_admin()` guard, exposes only `id`+`last_sign_in_at`, `authenticated`-only grants. Empirical role matrix confirmed: `anon` → `42501` (ACL); non-admin `authenticated` → `42501` (business, `RAISE EXCEPTION`); admin → `ok`.
- **Edge Function `admin-create-user`:** password policy 6→8 characters + ≥1 digit; the insert now sets `senha_temporaria=true`/`senha_gerada_em=now()`.
- **Staging deploy executed by the architect** (outside the credential reach of this session — the AI agent does not enter password/token/API key into any field, a permanent rule that cannot be bypassed by authorization).
- **Post-deploy verification — real E2E in staging, `result: PASS` (9/9), executed by the architect** via `scripts/staging/admin-create-user-password-policy-e2e.mjs`: 7 chars rejected (length); 8 chars without a digit rejected (digit); valid password accepted with `senha_temporaria=true`/`senha_gerada_em` filled, confirmed via REST; cleanup via `admin-delete-user` with zero cleanup confirmed.
- **Local tests:** 4 new/extended smoke suites totaling 71/71 (schema db/58, RPC db/59, `admin-create-user` password policy, extended `db/` allow-list); regression `tests/admin-*.smoke.js` + `boot.smoke.js` 263/263 with no regression. `git diff --check` clean.
- **Documentation corrected:** `docs/operations/AUTH_USER_PROVISIONING_RUNBOOK.md` (outdated password policy → 8+digit, note on `senha_temporaria`/mandatory future change in `A4.2`); `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` (entries for `db/58`/`db/59` + classification of the E2E runner as verification tooling, same treatment as `admin-disable-user-e2e.mjs`).
- **Not implemented (out of scope):** consumption of the RPC in the UI (the "Último acesso" column); `A4.2` (boot guard + mandatory change screen); `A4.3` (`NOT AUTHORIZED`).
- **Accesses:** Supabase MCP used to apply/verify the two migrations in staging; production (`bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew`) not accessed; no push.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked (`supabase/.temp/` is a local untracked cache of the Supabase CLI, generated by the architect's action).
- **Next authorizable action:** `ARCHITECT DECISION` — candidates: micro-phase to consume the `db/59` RPC in the UI (the "Último acesso" column in `js/screens/admin-usuarios.js`, under a mockup gate if it involves a new visual element); `A4.2` (boot guard + mandatory change screen, visual gate); `A2.1`/`A6.1` of `G28-CAMADA-2` remain candidates with no unambiguous priority.

## Camada 2 — Mandatory Password Change Guard — A4.2 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `6c624ef` — `Add mandatory password change gate` (`js/auth.js`, `js/boot.js`, `js/trocar-senha-writes.js` (new), `js/screens/trocar-senha-obrigatoria.js` (new), `scripts/staging/trocar-senha-obrigatoria-e2e.mjs` (new, tooling), `index.html`, `tests/auth.smoke.js`, `tests/boot.smoke.js`, `tests/trocar-senha-obrigatoria.smoke.js` (new)). **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close mandatory password change phase`). The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Hard stop resolved (Option A, explicit architect decision):** `js/auth.js` extends only the `select` of `loadCurrentUser()` (`+senha_temporaria, +senha_gerada_em`) — no other line touched, §11 preserved. The guard lives entirely in `js/boot.js` (`isSenhaTemporariaExpirada`, `guardedHandleRoute`) without touching `js/router.js`.
- **RLS/grants verified in staging before coding:** `usuarios_self_update` + `authenticated` with `UPDATE` on `senha_temporaria`/`senha_gerada_em` — self-update works without a new policy.
- **Self-service write (`js/trocar-senha-writes.js`):** `trocarSenhaObrigatoria(userId, novaSenha)` — `auth.updateUser({password})` + `UPDATE usuarios SET senha_temporaria=false`; `{ok:false, stage:'auth'|'flag'}` reports partial state explicitly.
- **Screen (`js/screens/trocar-senha-obrigatoria.js`, 243 lines):** shell-less card, live checklist (8+ characters / 1 digit / passwords match), button enabled only with the 3 criteria, eye toggle, "Sair da conta"; `expired` mode (>7 days) without fields. Mockup approved by the architect on 2026-07-16.
- **Tests:** `tests/trocar-senha-obrigatoria.smoke.js` (new) 14/14; `tests/boot.smoke.js` extended 44/44 (13 new, incl. integration via real `main()`); `tests/auth.smoke.js` extended 37/43 (3 new + 1 corrected; the 6 that fail are pre-existing debt confirmed via `git stash`, not from this phase). `git diff --check` clean.
- **Verification without credentials (local preview):** the real screen rendered via a diagnostic overlay — the checklist reacts to keystrokes with correct computed colors, the button disables/enables, the eye toggle confirmed, `expired` mode without fields. Console without errors.
- **Authenticated leg validation — CONFIRMED BY THE ARCHITECT (manual validation in staging `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`):** synthetic user created through the new flow, gate shown at first login, checklist reacted, change performed, `senha_temporaria` zeroed, second login entered directly without a gate. Test user removed. Equivalent automated runner (`scripts/staging/trocar-senha-obrigatoria-e2e.mjs`) created for future re-execution — not executed in this phase (login with a real password is an exclusively human action, never the AI agent's, a permanent rule).
- **Debt recorded (candidate for `CODE-HEALTH-AUDIT-§18-R1`):** the 6 pre-existing tests in `tests/auth.smoke.js` with an outdated `<script src="js/auth.js">` regex (not accounting for `?v=`) — not fixed here, out of scope.
- **Documentation continuity debt — RESOLVED on 2026-07-16:** the micro-phase `CAMADA2-LAST-ACCESS-UI` (technical commit `0aff22f` — `Add last sign-in column to user admin`) had its implementation report delivered (`AGUARDANDO VALIDAÇÃO VISUAL DO ARQUITETO`) but the session proceeded directly to `A4.2` without an explicit `OK` or a closeout order for that micro-phase specifically. The architect confirmed the visual validation and authorized the formal closeout together with the authorization of `A5.1-A5.2` — see the section "Camada 2 — Last Access RPC Consumption in the UI — CAMADA2-LAST-ACCESS-UI" below.
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked (`supabase/.temp/` pre-existing, not from this session).
- **Next authorizable action:** `ARCHITECT DECISION` among `A2.1` (schema `nivel_acesso`), `A6.1` (audit schema/trigger) and `A5.1-A5.2` (admin password reset). This entry does not authorize its execution.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Camada 2 — Mandatory Password Change Guard — A4.2") and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).
- **Mandatory documentation continuity — relay in every future handoff:**

## Camada 2 — Last Access RPC Consumption in the UI — CAMADA2-LAST-ACCESS-UI — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `0aff22f` — `Add last sign-in column to user admin` (`js/admin-usuarios-writes.js`, `js/screens/admin-usuarios.js`, `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js`). **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close last sign-in column phase`). The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Scope:** `fetchLastSignIn()` (one call per `reload()`, client-side merge by `id`) + "ULTIMO ACESSO" column in the grid (`dd/mm/aaaa hh:mm`; `"—"` for null) + "Último acesso" sorting (most recent first, nulls last) + fail-closed in case of RPC failure (entire column `"—"` + `console.warn`, the list stays visible).
- **Tests:** `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js` extended 23/23; regression `boot`+`cadastros-screens`+`admin-*` 298/298. `git diff --check` clean.
- **Visual validation — CONFIRMED BY THE ARCHITECT on 2026-07-16 (local preview, staging `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`):** column populated with real data, correct format, `"—"` for the never-logged-in, sorting with nulls last.
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked (`supabase/.temp/` pre-existing, not from this session).
- **Next authorizable action:** already superseded — `A5.1-A5.2` authorized and in progress; see its own section.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Camada 2 — Last Access RPC Consumption in the UI") and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).

## Camada 2 — Administrative Password Reset — A5.1-A5.2 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `b726717` — `Add admin password reset` (`supabase/functions/admin-reset-user-password/index.ts` (new), `supabase/functions/admin-reset-user-password/README.md` (new), `js/admin-usuarios-writes.js`, `js/screens/admin-usuarios.js`, `js/screens/admin-usuarios-modal.js`, `scripts/staging/admin-reset-password-e2e.mjs` (new), `tests/admin-reset-user-password.smoke.js` (new), `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js`). **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close admin password reset phase`). The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Architect decision — self-reset BLOCKED:** an admin cannot reset their own password (`SELF_RESET_FORBIDDEN`) — they use the normal change flow (self-service, `A4.2`). No "last admin" guard (resetting a password deactivates no one).
- **Edge Function `admin-reset-user-password`:** mirror of `admin-disable-user`; temporary password via `crypto.getRandomValues` (12 chars, no visual ambiguity, ≥1 digit guaranteed); `auth.admin.updateUserById(target, {password})`; marks `senha_temporaria=true`/`senha_gerada_em=now()`; never logs the password; returns the password a single time. A post-reset failure in the profile update (with no safe compensation possible) returns an explicit error (`PROFILE_UPDATE_FAILED`).
- **UI:** key-icon button → `confirmDialog` (never `window.confirm`) → success: "Senha gerada" modal (password shown once, copy button, non-re-display warning). Error → toast, no ambiguous state.
- **Staging deploy executed by the architect** (outside the credential reach of this session, a permanent rule).
- **Post-deploy verification — real E2E in staging, `result: PASS` (15/15), executed by the architect** via `scripts/staging/admin-reset-password-e2e.mjs` (`test_user_id 170f8479-e2da-4a6d-b597-080716be9c20`): guards `SELF_RESET_FORBIDDEN`/`NOT_FOUND`; real reset with flag+timestamp updated; old password invalidated; login with the new temporary one confirms `senha_temporaria=true`; `A4.2` self-service chained (new change + flag zeroed); relogin without a gate; zero cleanup.
- **Tests:** `tests/admin-reset-user-password.smoke.js` (new) 23/23; `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js` extended 29/29 (6 new); consolidated regression 268/275 (7 = pre-existing debt confirmed, none new). `git diff --check` clean.
- **Architect visual validation — WAIVED BY EXPLICIT DECISION**, covered by the combination of e2e `PASS` + flow verification in a real browser by the executor (button → `confirmDialog` → password modal with single display/copy/warning; self-reset guard confirmed with real `.disabled` values in the DOM).
- **Finding recorded — candidate `UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX` (`NOT AUTHORIZED`, severity `NOT CONFIRMED`):** `js/ui.js`'s `el()` does not handle a boolean in `setAttribute` — potentially affects the Deactivate/Delete buttons in `admin-usuarios.js` (same root cause as the residue already fixed in `expedicao-admin.js`). Treat as a potential active regression until the architect verifies it directly in staging. Not fixed (outside the `A5.1-A5.2` manifest).
- **Finding recorded — decomposition candidate (`CODE-HEALTH-AUDIT-§18-R1`):** `js/screens/admin-usuarios-modal.js` at 576 lines (above the acceptable 500) after accommodating the 4th modal.
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked (`supabase/.temp/` pre-existing, not from this session).
- **Next authorizable action:** `ARCHITECT DECISION` among `A5.3-A5.4` (reactivation), `UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX`, `A2.1` (access level) and `A6.1` (audit). This entry does not authorize its execution.
- **Full detail:** `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (section "Camada 2 — Administrative Password Reset — A5.1-A5.2") and `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).

## Camada 2 — User Reactivation — A5.3-A5.4 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `f886e26` — `Add admin user reactivation` (`supabase/functions/admin-reactivate-user/index.ts` (new), `supabase/functions/admin-reactivate-user/README.md` (new), `js/admin-usuarios-writes.js`, `js/screens/admin-usuarios.js`, `js/screens/admin-usuarios-modal.js`, `scripts/staging/admin-reactivate-e2e.mjs` (new), `tests/admin-reactivate-user.smoke.js` (new), `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js`). **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close admin user reactivation phase`). The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Edge Function `admin-reactivate-user`:** symmetric counterpart of `admin-disable-user` — `ativo=true`, clears `desativado_em`/`desativado_por`/`motivo_desativacao`, `auth.admin.updateUserById(target, {ban_duration:'none'})`. Guards: target must exist (`NOT_FOUND`) and be inactive (`REACTIVATE_NOT_INACTIVE` otherwise — deliberately **not** idempotent, unlike `admin-disable-user`'s `already_disabled`: reactivating an already-active user is a caller error, there is no ambiguous "already reactivated" state to collapse into); self-reactivation guarded (`SELF_REACTIVATE_FORBIDDEN`) though practically unreachable (an inactive target is banned and cannot hold a session). **Compensation-on-partial-failure design:** if the Auth unban call fails after the profile has already been marked `ativo=true`, the function reverts to the *exact* previous inactive state — `desativado_em`/`desativado_por`/`motivo_desativacao` are read and preserved **before** the update, not re-stamped with new values — returning `AUTH_UNBAN_FAILED`; if the reversion itself fails, `COMPENSATION_FAILED` (manual action required), same pattern as `admin-disable-user`.
- **UI:** inactive rows swap the ban icon for a refresh icon in the same action slot, wired to a new `confirmDialog` (non-destructive blue button) → `reativarUsuario(userId)` → success/error toast. Active rows unchanged.
- **Staging deploy executed by the architect** (outside the credential reach of this session, a permanent rule).
- **Post-deploy verification — real E2E in staging, `result: PASS` (13/13 steps), executed by the architect** via `scripts/staging/admin-reactivate-e2e.mjs` (`test_user_id 860b6fea-ac9e-45b1-8b85-9cfa255020e4`): synthetic user created → login confirmed → disabled via the existing `admin-disable-user` flow → login blocked (banned) → reactivated via the new Edge Function (`ativo=true`, `auth_banned=false`) → flags confirmed cleared in `public.usuarios` → login restored → guard `REACTIVATE_NOT_INACTIVE` confirmed on the now-active target → cleanup via `admin-delete-user` with zero cleanup confirmed.
- **Tests:** `tests/admin-reactivate-user.smoke.js` (new) 22/22; `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js` extended 35/35 (6 new); consolidated regression across the touched suites (`admin-usuarios`/`admin-reactivate-user`/`admin-disable-user`/`admin-reset-user-password`/`boot`/`cadastros-screens`) 195/195, no regressions. `git diff --check` clean.
- **Architect visual validation:** Desativar button on an active user **CONFIRMED WORKING** in staging — this also resolves, for this one control, the risk flagged in the `A5.1-A5.2` finding below (the `A5.3-A5.4` rewrite dropped the vulnerable `disabled: <boolean>` key from the Desativar/Reativar button entirely, as a side effect of the icon-swap logic, not a deliberate fix of `js/ui.js`). Icon-swap + Reativar flow: **issue found and diagnosed** (see next bullet) — not itself a defect in the Reativar code delivered this phase.
- **`UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX` — severity updated from `NOT CONFIRMED` to `CONFIRMED — ACTIVE REGRESSION`:** while validating the Reativar flow, the architect found that a disabled user disappears from the Usuários screen and stays gone even with "Mostrar inativos" checked — the checkbox "persists marked when clicking" (does not visually reflect its real state). Root cause diagnosed: `js/screens/admin-usuarios.js`'s toggle passes `checked: mostrarInativos` straight into `window.el()`, which calls `node.setAttribute('checked', mostrarInativos)` unconditionally; since `renderStandalone()` creates a brand-new `<input>` on every re-render, the `checked` attribute is always present (`"true"` or `"false"` as a string), and HTML boolean attributes are true-by-presence regardless of value — so the fresh checkbox always renders checked, independent of the actual `mostrarInativos` state. Exact same root cause as the `disabled="null"` residue already fixed once in `expedicao-admin.js`, now empirically reproduced via a second control. The Excluir button in the same file (`disabled: !!(meId && user.id === meId)`) carries the identical pattern and is unconfirmed but suspect by the same evidence. **Not fixed in this phase** — outside the `A5.3-A5.4` manifest, and mixing this diagnosis with a patch here would violate `CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md` §14. Recorded as the priority `ARCHITECT DECISION` candidate (see `PROJECT_STATE.md`).
- **Finding unchanged — decomposition candidate (`CODE-HEALTH-AUDIT-§18-R1`):** `js/screens/admin-usuarios-modal.js` grew from 576 to 604 lines accommodating the 5th modal (`openReativarModal`); already a recorded candidate, no action taken.
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging empty; zero untracked (`supabase/.temp/` pre-existing, not from this session).
- **Next authorizable action:** `ARCHITECT DECISION` among `UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX` (now `CONFIRMED — ACTIVE REGRESSION`, recommended priority), `A2.1` (access level) and `A6.1` (audit). `A3.4` unlocks once the remaining `A2`/`A6` subphases close. This entry does not authorize its execution.

## UI-ACTION-BUTTON — Helper Primitive — phase ii — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `bbfd58c` — `Add actionButton primitive per visual contract` (`js/ui.js`, `tests/ui-action-button.smoke.js` (new)). **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close actionButton primitive phase`). The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Front:** `UI-ACTION-BUTTON` track, phase `ii`, follow-up to phase `i` (`docs/architecture/UI_VISUAL_CONTRACT.md` §8.1 carve-out, commit `f30aa0d`, `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`).
- **`actionButton({ title, icon, danger, disabled, onclick, srLabel })` added to `js/ui.js`:** implements §8.1 verbatim — 30×30px, radius 4px, border `#eceef1`/background `#fff` rest, color `#8a93a3` neutral / `#d6403a` danger, 14px icon slot (caller-supplied Node), hover via `mouseenter`/`mouseleave` matching the Clientes reference (neutral `border-color:#d0d5de;color:#3f4757`; danger `border-color:#fca5a5;background:#fff1f1;color:#c53030`), safe boolean `disabled` pattern (key present only when `true`, per `UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX`), mandatory sr-only label via the clip-rect pattern (never `display:none`). `confirmDialog` gating on destructive actions remains the caller's responsibility, noted in the header comment.
- **Purely additive — zero call sites migrated**, as scoped; no other `js/ui.js` change; `el()` untouched.
- **Tests:** `node --check` PASS; `tests/ui-action-button.smoke.js` (new) **14/14** — dimensions/rest-state attrs, sr-only-not-`display:none`, disabled-key-only-when-`true` (via the DOM-coercion-aware double introduced for `UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX`), both hover variants restored on `mouseleave`, onclick wiring and its absence when disabled. Full regression, in-place stash-verified (not worktree, to avoid the CRLF artifact found during the `UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX` phase): before 3634/3473/161 fail, after 3648/3487/161 fail — exactly the 14 new tests, all passing, byte-identical failing-test-name sets before/after. (161 vs. an earlier session's 156 is pre-existing `write-guard.smoke.js` `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8765` noise — no local static server running, reproduced identically with `js/ui.js` reverted — unrelated to this change.)
- **Architect acceptance:** confirmed; no visual gate required for this phase (no screen consumes the helper yet).
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging by literal path only; `supabase/.temp/` pre-existing, not from this session.
- **Next authorizable action:** already superseded — `UI-ACTION-BUTTON-MIGRATION-1` was authorized and closed; see its own section below for the current state of "next action".
- **Full detail:** `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry). No `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` section added — out of this closeout's explicit scope (`PROJECT_STATE`/`HANDOFF`/ledger only).

## UI-ACTION-BUTTON — Order Lists Migration — phase iii, lot 1 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `31b66af` — `Migrate order lists to actionButton` (`js/screens/pedidos-list.js`, `js/screens/cliente-pedidos-list.js`, `tests/pedidos-list.smoke.js`, `tests/cliente-pedidos-list.smoke.js`). **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close order lists migration phase`). The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Front:** `UI-ACTION-BUTTON` track, phase `iii`, lot `1` (worst-offender screens, as ratified), follow-up to phase `ii` (`actionButton()` primitive, commit `bbfd58c`, `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`).
- **Migrated:** `pedidos-list.js`'s `rowActions()` (eyeBtn "Visualizar", deleteBtn "Excluir Pedido") and `navBtn()` (pagination ◀/▶); `cliente-pedidos-list.js`'s row `eyeBtn` ("Ver pedido") and `navBtn()`. All now build via `window.actionButton()` per §8.1: 30×30px, radius 4px, border `#eceef1`/bg `#fff`, 14px icons (shrunk from 17px), hover, safe boolean `disabled`, mandatory sr-only label. Row-actions gap tightened 8px→6px per the ratified spec.
- **Same handlers preserved:** `pedidos-list.js`'s Excluir still calls `excluirPedido()` → `window.RAVATEX_DELETE.excluirPedidoComFluxo()`, which already gates the destructive action via its own confirmation flow (`showDeleteConfirmation` in `js/delete-helpers.js`) — no redundant `confirmDialog` wrapper added.
- **A11y conformance gain, not a feature:** both screens' pagination nav buttons previously had **no accessible name at all**; migrating to `actionButton()` gave them `title`="Página anterior"/"Próxima página" (and the mandatory sr-only label) for free.
- **Two judgments ratified by the architect at this closeout, standing for all remaining lots:** (1) existing domain-specific confirmation flows satisfy the §8.1 destructive guard without a redundant `confirmDialog` wrapper; (2) §8.1 dimension/sr-only/disabled correctness is proven once at the `actionButton()` primitive level (`tests/ui-action-button.smoke.js`) — screen-level smokes assert call-site routing only (which `actionButton()` args each call site passes), not re-proving the primitive's internals.
- **Tests:** `node --check` PASS on all 4 touched files; both smokes extended with static conformance checks (matching their existing 100%-static testing style — neither had runtime DOM rendering, so there were no "old style" assertions to replace; new assertions added instead): call sites route through `actionButton()` with correct `title`/`danger`/`disabled`/`onclick`; old 3px-radius/17px-icon/imperative-override patterns confirmed gone; destructive handler confirmed unchanged. Full regression, in-place stash-verified: before `3648`/`3492`/`156` fail → after `3660`/`3504`/`156` fail — exactly the 12 new tests, all passing, byte-identical failing-test-name sets before/after.
- **Architect visual validation — CONFIRMED:** both `#/pedidos` and `#/cliente/pedidos` validated against the Clients screen reference.

## UI-ACTION-BUTTON — Users and Ops Screens Migration — phase iii, lot 2 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `abfb95e` — `Migrate users and ops screens to actionButton` (`js/screens/admin-usuarios.js`, `js/screens/ops-list.js`, `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js`, `tests/ops-list-screen.smoke.js`). **Documentation commit:** this closeout (`Close users and ops screens migration phase`). The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Front:** `UI-ACTION-BUTTON` track, phase `iii`, lot `2`, follow-up to lot `1` (`UI-ACTION-BUTTON-MIGRATION-1`, commit `31b66af`, `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`).
- **Migrated:** `admin-usuarios.js`'s 4 row actions (Editar, Resetar senha, Desativar/Reativar swap, Excluir) and `ops-list.js`'s row actions (Editar/Ver, Excluir OP) plus its pagination `navBtn()`. All rebuilt via `window.actionButton()` per §8.1 — same handlers, same modal/`confirmDialog` gating, same disabled self-guards, same icon-swap logic; only the button rendering changed. The 0.6 inactive-row opacity and approved-mockup behavior untouched.
- **`ops-list.js` a11y fix:** the row-action sr-only label previously used `display:none` (hides it from assistive tech too, defeating the purpose — the exact defect recorded during the conformance diagnosis); `actionButton()` provides the correct clip-rect pattern natively, no extra code needed at the call site.
- **`ops-list.js` Excluir OP gains `danger` styling:** was neutral gray (same as Editar/Ver) before this migration; now red, matching every other Excluir action already migrated in the app.
- **Users-screen ACOES column-width fix (architect's addendum, honored though not repeated in the formal order text):** the column was hardcoded `102px`, but 4 `actionButton()`s need `30×4 + 6×3 = 138px` — widened via the single `gridTemplate` variable (shared by the header row and every data row), no other layout change.
- **A11y conformance gain, not a feature:** `ops-list.js`'s pagination nav buttons previously had no accessible name; migration gave them `title`="Página anterior"/"Próxima página" for free.
- **Tests:** `node --check` PASS on all 4 touched files. `admin-usuarios.smoke.js`: 3 new tests (sr-only clip-rect on all 4 row buttons; danger confirmed on Excluir, neutral confirmed unchanged on Desativar/Reativar; ACOES grid-template confirmed `138px`, old `102px` confirmed gone) — all 39 pre-existing tests kept passing unmodified. `ops-list-screen.smoke.js`: FakeNode gained `removeAttribute`/`hasAttribute` (defense-in-depth, matching the established fix pattern); 5 new tests (sr-only clip-rect never `display:none`; danger color on Excluir OP; handler/gating unchanged — `excluirOPComFluxo`, no `window.confirm`; pagination titles present; icons confirmed 14px) — all 19 pre-existing-passing tests kept passing, the 11 pre-existing failures (index-inline-related, confirmed via stash-diff to predate this change) unchanged. Full regression, in-place stash-verified: before `3660`/`3499`/`161` fail → after `3668`/`3507`/`161` fail — exactly the 8 new tests, all passing, byte-identical failing-test-name sets.
- **Architect visual validation — CONFIRMED:** users screen validated against the Clients reference (the original complaint's own test); `#/ops` spot-checked.
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging by literal path only; `supabase/.temp/` pre-existing, not from this session.
- **Next authorizable action:** already superseded — `UI-USERS-GRID-TEXT-OVERFLOW` (small follow-up, own order) was authorized and closed; see its own section below. Lot `3` (`cadastros.js`) of `UI-ACTION-BUTTON` remains `NOT AUTHORIZED`, pending its own order. Registered candidates unchanged: `MODAL-BUTTON-CSS-CHECK` (read-only), `fornecedor.js` visual redesign (separate track) — see `PROJECT_STATE.md`.
- **Full detail:** `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry). No `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` section added — out of this closeout's explicit scope (`PROJECT_STATE`/`HANDOFF`/ledger only).

## Users Grid — Text Overflow Ellipsis — UI-USERS-GRID-TEXT-OVERFLOW — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `3e95e86` — `Add text overflow ellipsis to users grid` (`js/screens/admin-usuarios.js`, `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js`). **Documentation commit:** this closeout, folded into the same phase per the architect's order (low-effort, mechanical). The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Front:** presentation-only follow-up to `UI-ACTION-BUTTON-MIGRATION-2` (users screen only, no relation to the `UI-ACTION-BUTTON` contract track otherwise).
- **Fix:** E-MAIL/NOME/FORNECEDOR/CLIENTE grid cells now truncate to a single line with an ellipsis (`white-space:nowrap; overflow:hidden; text-overflow:ellipsis; min-width:0` — the last required for ellipsis inside a CSS grid track), applied consistently to header and data cells. Each truncated cell carries a `title` attribute with the full value (omitted when the displayed value is the "—" fallback, to avoid a useless tooltip). New local pure helper `truncatedCell(displayText, rawValue, colorStyle)` in `js/screens/admin-usuarios.js`, reused across the 4 cells.
- **Resulting grid template:** `2fr 1fr 110px 1fr 1fr 90px 130px 138px` (E-MAIL / NOME / TIPO / FORNECEDOR / CLIENTE / STATUS / ULTIMO ACESSO / ACOES) — E-MAIL widened from `1.3fr` to `2fr`; NOME/FORNECEDOR/CLIENTE unchanged at `1fr`; TIPO/STATUS/ULTIMO ACESSO/ACOES (`138px`, from `UI-ACTION-BUTTON-MIGRATION-2`) unchanged.
- **No data/handler/button change** — pure CSS + a `title` attribute; TIPO/STATUS badges and ULTIMO ACESSO untouched.
- **Tests:** `node --check` PASS. `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js` extended with 4 new tests (grid-template report exact match; E-MAIL cell nowrap/overflow/ellipsis/min-width + full-value title with a long synthetic address, full text confirmed still in the DOM — the cut is CSS-only; NOME/FORNECEDOR/CLIENTE same treatment, title absent on "—" cells; header cells carry the same truncation treatment, TIPO/STATUS confirmed without ellipsis) — all 42 pre-existing tests kept passing (one existing test's grid-template filter regex updated from `1\.3fr` to `2fr` to match the new leading fraction; no assertion semantics changed). Full regression, in-place stash-verified: before `3668`/`3512`/`156` fail → after `3672`/`3516`/`156` fail — exactly the 4 new tests, all passing, byte-identical failing-test-name sets.
- **Architect visual gate — NOT independently verified by the agent:** no live/staging browser session available in this environment (same standing limitation as prior UI phases). The architect's own quick check (long synthetic email truncates with "…", hover shows the full address, no row-height jump, no horizontal scroll) is the operative verification for this phase; not separately re-confirmed here beyond the automated DOM-structure tests above.
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging by literal path only; `supabase/.temp/` pre-existing, not from this session.
- **Next authorizable action:** `ARCHITECT DECISION` — no single unambiguous candidate; `UI-ACTION-BUTTON` lot `3` (`cadastros.js`), `A2.1`, `A6.1` remain on the table, none authorized by this record.
- **Full detail:** `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).

## Camada 2 — User Audit Trail Schema + Trigger — A6.1 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `ee0e77b` — `Add user audit trail schema` (`db/60_usuarios_auditoria_schema.sql` new, `tests/document-decision-command-contract.test.js`). **Documentation commit:** this closeout. The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Front:** `G28-CAMADA-2`, subphase `A6.1` (schema + trigger, first of `A6.1 → A6.2 → A6.3`), per `docs/architecture/CAMADA2_USUARIOS_SPEC_PROPOSED.md` §A6. Scope was schema/migration in staging only — no UI, no Edge Function, no boot, no production, per the architect's explicit order.
- **Schema:** `public.usuarios_eventos` (append-only) + `trg_usuario_evento` trigger (`AFTER UPDATE ON public.usuarios`), mirroring `public.op_eventos`/`trg_op_evento` (db/21) and `public.document_link_revisions` (db/51). Trigger diffs `to_jsonb(OLD)`/`to_jsonb(NEW)` over the watched fields `ativo`, `tipo`, `nivel_acesso` (column not yet added by `A2.1` — silently skipped via the `to_jsonb` existence check, no follow-up migration needed when it lands), `senha_temporaria`; records one `perfil_alterado` row per UPDATE with only the changed keys.
- **Actor-resolution / no-double-recording design decision:** the trigger records only when `auth.uid() IS NOT NULL` — the direct-PostgREST-UPDATE admin path (`js/admin-usuarios-writes.js` `updateUsuario`). When `auth.uid() IS NULL` (the five Edge Functions, `service_role`, no JWT in that DB connection), the trigger is a no-op; `A6.2` will insert those events explicitly with the actor id it already resolved from its own caller's JWT, avoiding a double entry once wired.
- **RLS + grants:** admin-only `SELECT` (`is_admin()`); `REVOKE ALL FROM PUBLIC/anon/authenticated`, `GRANT SELECT TO authenticated`; no client `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` policy — writes only via the `SECURITY DEFINER` trigger function, matching the `document_link_revisions` model.
- **Staging verify (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`, transactional `BEGIN…ROLLBACK`, synthetic-value fixtures on two real staging users, zero permanent mutation):** trigger fires on `ativo`/`senha_temporaria` changes with correct payload shape (`{"<campo>":{"de":...,"para":...}}`) and correct `ator_id`; same-value no-op UPDATE does not record; simulated `auth.uid() IS NULL` (service_role) context does not double-record; `anon` denied `42501` (no grant at all); authenticated non-admin denied by RLS (0 rows, despite a seeded row existing); authenticated admin reads the seeded row. Full role matrix in `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md`.
- **Migrations registry:** before — highest recorded `59_admin_last_sign_in_readmodel`; after — `60_usuarios_auditoria_schema` recorded immediately following, no gap.
- **Tests:** `tests/document-decision-command-contract.test.js` **23/23** (allow-list extended for `db/60` per the `db/51/52/58/59` precedent). Full-suite file-swap-against-HEAD comparison: before `3704`/`3547`/`157` fail → after `3704`/`3548`/`156` fail — exactly the one intended assertion flipped from fail to pass, zero new failures.
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging by literal path only; `supabase/.temp/` pre-existing, not from this session.
- **Next authorizable action:** `ARCHITECT DECISION` — `A6.2` (Edge Function wiring of `usuarios_eventos`, explicit insert in each of the 5 existing/new Edge Functions) is the natural next subphase of this track, but is not authorized by this record; `A6.3` (read-only UI panel) remains blocked on `A6.2`. Standing candidates unchanged otherwise: `UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX`, `A2.1`.
- **Full detail:** `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry, includes the full role matrix).

## Camada 2 — Preserve User Audit Events on Profile Deletion — A6.1-B — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `fa8e1b9` — `Preserve user audit events on profile deletion` (`db/61_usuarios_eventos_preserve_on_delete.sql` new, `tests/document-decision-command-contract.test.js`). **Documentation commit:** this closeout. The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Front:** `G28-CAMADA-2`, corrective migration discovered mid-`A6.2` authorization. `A6.2`'s order required confirming that `admin-delete-user`'s hard-delete of `public.usuarios` wouldn't destroy its own audit event; it does under `db/60`'s original `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `usuarios_eventos.usuario_id`, so `A6.2` was correctly HARD-STOPPED and reported instead of implemented with a workaround. `db/60` itself was not edited (applied, immutable) — this is a separate, additive corrective migration.
- **Root cause:** `admin-delete-user` (`supabase/functions/admin-delete-user/index.ts:238-241`) does `adminClient.from("usuarios").delete().eq("id", targetId)` directly. Under `ON DELETE CASCADE`, any `usuarios_eventos` row for that `usuario_id` — inserted before or after — is either destroyed in the same statement or impossible to insert (FK violation, parent already gone). No ordering of an explicit audit insert around the existing delete flow could produce a surviving event.
- **Architect ruling:** `CASCADE` rejected (destroys the trail); dropping the FK entirely rejected (loses integrity while the subject lives). Adopted: `usuario_id` FK → `ON DELETE SET NULL`, plus a denormalized identity snapshot (`usuario_email`, `usuario_nome`, `usuario_tipo`, all nullable) captured by the trigger at insert time from `NEW` — no extra query, no sensitive data (no password/token, no `fornecedor_id`/`cliente_id`; the event's own `payload` already carries the specific changed fields for `perfil_alterado`).
- **Schema:** `usuario_id` — `NOT NULL` dropped, FK dropped/recreated (dynamic discovery via a `pg_constraint` `DO` block, `db/21`-style) as `ON DELETE SET NULL`. `trigger_usuario_evento()` updated in place (`CREATE OR REPLACE`, same trigger binding — no re-`CREATE TRIGGER`) to populate the snapshot. Backfill statement included for correctness (0 rows affected at apply time — staging `usuarios_eventos` was empty). ACL/RLS re-asserted verbatim from `db/60`, verified in the live catalog post-apply.
- **Staging verify (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`, transactional `BEGIN…ROLLBACK`, synthetic fixtures, zero permanent mutation):** the full `db/60` role matrix re-run and green under the new schema (no regression), **plus the new survival case**: a fully synthetic `auth.users`/`public.usuarios` fixture generated one event, its profile was then `DELETE`d directly (mirroring `admin-delete-user`), and the event row **survived** with `usuario_id` NULL, identity snapshot intact and matching the fixture, `payload`/`tipo_evento` unchanged, still readable by an admin under RLS. Zero residue confirmed afterward. Full role matrix and survival-case detail in `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md`.
- **Migrations registry:** before — highest recorded `60_usuarios_auditoria_schema`; after — `61_usuarios_eventos_preserve_on_delete` recorded immediately following, no gap.
- **Tests:** `tests/document-decision-command-contract.test.js` **23/23** (allow-list extended for `db/61`). Full-suite file-swap-against-HEAD comparison: before `3704`/`3547`/`157` fail → after `3704`/`3548`/`156` fail — exactly the one intended assertion flipped from fail to pass, zero new failures.
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging by literal path only; `supabase/.temp/` pre-existing, not from this session.
- **Next authorizable action:** `A6.2` (Edge Function audit wiring) resumes — the schema now supports a surviving `admin-delete-user` audit event. Not authorized by this record; requires the architect to explicitly resume/re-authorize `A6.2` (it was previously authorized once, then paused by the HARD STOP this phase resolves — this closeout does not itself re-open or re-authorize that order).
- **Full detail:** `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry).

## Camada 2 — Audit Trail Wiring (Edge Functions) — A6.2 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commits:** `b67b126` — `Add audit trail writes to admin Edge Functions` (the five Edge Functions + their smoke tests) and `7309349` — `Add A6.2 usuarios_eventos audit trail e2e runner` (`scripts/staging/usuarios-audit-e2e.mjs`). **Documentation commit:** this closeout. The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Front:** `G28-CAMADA-2`, subphase `A6.2` (Edge Function audit wiring), resumed after `A6.1-B` resolved the FK HARD STOP that had paused it.
- **Per-function table:**

  | Function | tipo_evento | payload shape | insert placement | failure rule |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `admin-create-user` | `usuario_criado` | `{tipo, fornecedor_id, cliente_id}` | last step, after profile insert succeeds | log + `audit_recorded:false`, action stands |
  | `admin-disable-user` | `usuario_desativado` | `{ativo:{de:true,para:false}, motivo}` | last step, after profile update + Auth ban succeed | log + flag, action stands |
  | `admin-reactivate-user` | `usuario_reativado` | `{ativo:{de:false,para:true}}` | last step, after profile update + Auth unban succeed | log + flag, action stands |
  | `admin-reset-user-password` | `senha_resetada` | `{}` (always empty — password never touches audit) | last step, after Auth reset + profile flag succeed | log + flag, action stands |
  | `admin-delete-user` | `usuario_excluido` | `{}` | **before** the profile delete (architect ruling — FK satisfiable only while the row exists; `db/61`'s `ON DELETE SET NULL` lets it survive) | log + flag on insert failure, action stands; **no compensation invented** on the delete's own failure/compensation paths — the event remains as a recorded but not literally accurate "attempted" entry, a documented, accepted trade-off |

- **Common design (all five):** `ator_id` is the caller resolved from the validated JWT (never `auth.uid()`, `NULL` under `service_role`). Identity snapshot (`usuario_email`/`usuario_nome`/`usuario_tipo`) populated explicitly in every insert, since `trigger_usuario_evento()` (`db/60`) excludes itself under `service_role` by design — this is the canonical two-write-paths design now recorded in `PROJECT_STATE.md` ("Binding decisions in force") and `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` §4.
- **Delete-ordering trade-off (recorded, accepted):** `admin-delete-user`'s audit insert precedes the profile delete by architect ruling. If the delete subsequently fails (`USER_HAS_REFERENCES`) or is compensated (`AUTH_DELETE_FAILED`, profile reinserted), the `usuario_excluido` event remains — it records an attempted deletion of a profile that, in the end, was not deleted. No compensation was invented for the audit row on those paths; this is a deliberate, documented scope boundary, not a silent bug.
- **Tests:** 5 smoke files extended (+37 tests: event insert present, `tipo_evento`/`ator_id`/payload shape, no-password assertion, insert-ordering, failure-flag behavior, no audit-table compensation on delete). File-swap regression: `3548`/`156 fail` → `3585`/`156 fail` — zero regressions.
- **Staging E2E (`scripts/staging/usuarios-audit-e2e.mjs`, run by the architect):** `result: PASS`, `15/15` steps, `2026-07-17`, synthetic user `c0d5da9c-471c-459f-b0c4-02110fa81709`. Confirmed: exactly one event per action across all five functions (no double-entry from the trigger under `service_role`); correct `tipo_evento`/`ator_id`/payload/snapshot per action; password absent from the `senha_resetada` payload in any form; all 5 accumulated events survive `admin-delete-user` with `usuario_id` NULL and identity snapshot intact; `public.usuarios`/`auth.users` cleanup zero (the 5 orphaned `usuarios_eventos` rows are the intended, permanent audit-trail artifact, not residue — the table is append-only by design, no `DELETE` policy for any client role).
- **Deploy:** the five Edge Functions deployed to staging (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`) by the architect — outside this session's credential reach.
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging by literal path only; `supabase/.temp/` pre-existing, not from this session.
- **Next authorizable action:** `A6.3` (read-only audit panel) — mockup gate is the only prerequisite per `docs/architecture/CAMADA2_USUARIOS_SPEC_PROPOSED.md`; closes the `A6` track. Not authorized by this record.
- **Full detail:** `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` (append-only entry), `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` §4 (`db/60`/`db/61` rows + narrative entry).

## Camada 2 — User Audit Panel (read-only) — A6.3 — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `e31f269` — `Add user audit panel` (`js/admin-usuarios-audit-read-model.js` new, `js/admin-usuarios-writes.js`, `js/screens/admin-usuarios-audit-panel.js` new, `js/screens/admin-usuarios-modal.js`, `index.html`, `tests/admin-usuarios-audit-panel.smoke.js` new, `tests/admin-usuarios-audit-read-model.test.js` new, `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js`, `tests/boot.smoke.js`). **Documentation commit:** this closeout. The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Front:** `G28-CAMADA-2`, subphase `A6.3` (read-only audit panel), closes the `A6` track. Mockup gate satisfied by the architect (2026-07-17) before authorization: panel inside the edit modal below a divider; one row per event (icon, action, actor + detail, timestamp); read-only label; §7.1 truncation on the detail line.
- **Read model (`js/admin-usuarios-audit-read-model.js`, pure, mirrors `document-link-audit-read-model.js`):** maps `usuarios_eventos` rows to a display shape for all 6 possible `tipo_evento` values (the 5 `A6.2` Edge-Function-recorded types plus the trigger's own `perfil_alterado`) — pt-BR action label, human-readable payload phrase, `dd/MM HH:mm` timestamp, defensive fallback for an unrecognized `tipo_evento`, and explicit handling of `usuario_id IS NULL` (`db/61` delete-survival) via a `subjectOrphaned` flag. Never throws.
- **Read helper (`js/admin-usuarios-writes.js` `fetchUsuarioEventos`):** plain RLS-filtered select on `usuarios_eventos` (admin-only, `db/60`) plus a second plain select on `usuarios` to resolve actor email/nome — no RPC, no migration (the order's escalation condition was never triggered).
- **Panel (`js/screens/admin-usuarios-audit-panel.js`, render-only):** divider, "Histórico" header with count badge and "somente leitura" label, one row per event (16px icon, action label, actor+detail via `window.truncatedCell` — §7.1 bundle — timestamp), 5 most recent visible with a "ver todos" toggle for the rest (max-height ~280px scrollable, no pagination). Icon vocabulary: 4 of 6 named explicitly by the mockup (user-plus green for created, ban red for disabled, refresh/key neutral for reactivated/reset); the remaining two (`usuario_excluido`, `perfil_alterado`) reuse this screen's own already-established trash/pencil icons — flagged as an assumption at the visual gate, confirmed acceptable.
- **Wiring:** `js/screens/admin-usuarios-modal.js` `openUsuarioModal`, edit branch only (`isEdit && usr && usr.id`) — no history exists yet on create. Panel load failure never breaks the modal: fail-closed to a discreet "Histórico indisponível", logged, form stays fully usable.
- **Tests:** +37 (22 pure read-model, 14 panel, 1 boot/script-order). File-swap regression: `3585`/`156 fail` → `3622`/`156 fail` — zero regressions.
- **Architect visual gate:** `CONFIRMED` (passed prior to the `UI-INVOKE-ENVELOPE-FIX` HARD STOP that interrupted this closeout).
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging by literal path only; `supabase/.temp/` pre-existing, not from this session.
- **Next authorizable action:** `G28-CAMADA-2 / A6` track is now `COMPLETE`. See the consolidated closeout note in `PROJECT_STATE.md` for the next front (`TEST-MOCK-FIDELITY-AUDIT`, read-only, promoted to priority).

## Admin Edge Function Response Envelope Fix — UI-INVOKE-ENVELOPE-FIX — CLOSED / ACCEPTED

- **Technical commit:** `7b37e8e` — `Fix admin Edge Function response envelope unwrap` (`js/admin-usuarios-writes.js`, `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js`). **Documentation commit:** this closeout. The current HEAD must be consulted with `git rev-parse HEAD`.
- **Front:** live defect surfaced by the `A6.3` architect visual gate — password reset succeeded in staging but the UI reported the generated password was not found (both a green "Senha resetada" and a red "…valor não foi encontrado" toast fired on the same action).
- **Root cause (confirmed against the real `@supabase/supabase-js` `FunctionsClient.invoke()` source):** `functions.invoke()` returns the raw parsed HTTP JSON body verbatim as `data` — it does not unwrap anything. Every admin-* Edge Function already wraps its payload in `{data: <payload>}` via `jsonResponse()` (`supabase/functions/_shared/response.ts`). Client-side call sites (`js/screens/admin-usuarios-modal.js`: `data.password`, `createData.user_id`, `data.ativo`) read one level too shallow — the real value lived at `data.data.*`. **Pre-existing since `A5.1-A5.2` (`resetarSenha`), not caused by `A6.2`** — `A6.2` only added `audit_recorded` inside the same already-mis-consumed envelope.
- **Fix:** `js/admin-usuarios-writes.js` — new `invokeAdminFunction(name, body)` is the single unwrap point for all five `functions.invoke()`-based writes (`createUsuario`, `disableUsuario`, `deleteUsuario`, `resetarSenha`, `reativarUsuario`). Existing call sites in `admin-usuarios-modal.js` needed no changes.
- **Why tests never caught it:** `tests/admin-usuarios.smoke.js`'s fake `functions.invoke()` mock returned the inner payload flat — one level shallower than the real client, so both sides of the bug were wrong in the same way and cancelled out. Corrected the mock to double-wrap like production.
- **Regression proof:** added 4 direct unwrap tests (one per write beyond the existing full-flow reset-password test) and verified against the pre-fix code with the corrected mock: **5 tests fail without the fix** (the 4 new + the existing full click-through reset-password test), confirming they are real regression guards. File-swap regression: `3622`/`156 fail` → `3626`/`156 fail` — zero collateral regressions.
- **Collateral finding, reported not fixed:** `js/screens/cadastros.js`'s frozen legacy `screenCadastrosUsuarios` has the identical `createUsuario` bug (`createData.user_id` silently `undefined`, observações-save step no-ops) — out of scope, untouched until `A3.4`. Recorded as one more `A3.4` justification.
- **Architect validation:** `OK` — reset shows the generated password, no red toast; create with observações saves correctly.
- **Production:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` not accessed. **Push:** not executed.
- **Final worktree state:** clean; staging by literal path only; `supabase/.temp/` pre-existing, not from this session.
- **Next authorizable action:** `TEST-MOCK-FIDELITY-AUDIT` (read-only, promoted to priority — see `PROJECT_STATE.md`), then `A2.1`/`A3.4`.
