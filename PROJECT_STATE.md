# CANONICAL CURRENT STATE

This file is the single source of the **current** operational state: active phase,
next authorizable action, binding decisions in force, live debts, environment facts,
and an index of closed phases. It does **not** hold historical closeout narratives —
those were moved by `PROJECT-STATE-COMPACTION-A` (2026-07-16) and `-B` (2026-07-17) to
`docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md`, verbatim; full per-phase closeouts
are in `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md`. HEAD/working tree/divergence: consult Git directly.

## Active phase and next action

- **`G28-MIGRATION-TRACK` (`PRODUCTION-MIGRATION-M0-M10`) — `COMPLETE / CLOSED`
  (2026-07-18).** The system is **LIVE IN PRODUCTION** at
  `inttracker-jade.vercel.app`, served by Vercel from `inttexsystem/inttracker`,
  running against Supabase `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk` with migrated data, deployed Edge
  Functions, repointed client config, and a repointed Ingestor. All eleven phases are
  recorded under "Migration governance": **`M0`-`M6`, `M8`, `M10` — `CLOSED /
  ACCEPTED`**; **`M7` (formal smoke phase) and `M9` (backup repoint + first real run)
  — `SUPERSEDED BY REALITY`** (the live-and-serving system is the de-facto smoke; the
  production backup mechanism was never stood up as scoped — folded into the
  `CAMADA3 BK5-BK8` post-launch debt). Phase order was not strictly numeric — `M8` ran
  ahead of `M4`-`M7` by direct order, and `M4`/`M5`/`M6`/`M10` were executed by the
  architect out-of-band and are recorded here as accomplished facts.
- **`BACKLOG FREEZE` — `LIFTED` (2026-07-18).** The freeze was scoped "until after
  cutover (`M10`)"; cutover is done. **New fronts are authorizable again**, each by
  its own individual order. The consolidated, ranked `POST-LAUNCH DEBT REGISTER`
  (below) supersedes the former "residual risk register (12 items)".
- **Next authorizable action:** any new front, by its own order. **The highest-consequence
  open item is `INGESTOR-DOC-CYCLE-VERIFY-DEFERRED` — an `ACTIVE PRODUCTION BLOCKER`:
  the Ingestor's Google OAuth token is expired, so no documents are entering the live
  system.** See the `POST-LAUNCH DEBT REGISTER`. **Standing reminder: flip the Supabase
  MCP back to read-only** (still management-scoped/write-capable from `M2`/`M3`).
- **`ORDEM-COMPRA-LIFECYCLE` track — spec `RATIFIED` (`ORDEM-COMPRA-LIFECYCLE-
  SPEC-RATIFICATION-R1`, 2026-07-18); Phase `A` (schema + config) `CLOSED /
  ACCEPTED` (2026-07-18).** `db/65_ordem_compra_lifecycle_schema.sql`
  applied and verified in staging (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`): the three
  orthogonal dimension columns (`status_administrativo`/`status_aceite`/
  `status_recebimento`) + audit columns on `ordens_compra_fio`, the new
  `ordem_compra_fio_lancamentos` ledger (empty, no trigger yet — Phase C),
  `ordem_compra_eventos` transition audit, and the `ordem_compra_config`
  singleton (`exige_aceite=false`), all admin-only-read/no-client-write
  (db/57/63 grants standard). `ALTER TABLE` + the one-time legacy-marking
  backfill ran in one transaction (binding gap 1). 14/14 verification-matrix
  checks passed (`BEGIN…ROLLBACK`, synthetic, cleanup confirmed zero);
  12/12 static smoke tests; full-suite regression unchanged (`+12` new
  tests, `140` pre-existing failures byte-identical before/after). No RPC,
  no UI, no JS change — zero behavior change for existing readers. Full
  detail: `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` Phase `A` entry,
  `docs/reports/ORDEM_COMPRA_PHASE_A_2026-07-18.md`. **New branch discipline
  (binding going forward):** implementation work lands on branch `dev`
  (created from this track's HEAD); `git push production dev` is a
  standing remote-backup authorization — push to `main` remains forbidden.
  **Spec AMENDED 2026-07-18 (`ORDEM-COMPRA SPEC AMENDMENT`): §6 (UI surface) +
  §8 (phasing) record the architect's separation-of-responsibilities ruling —
  receipt registration moves to the purchase order's own detail screen, the
  OP-screen section becomes a READER (registers nothing), and Phase B is split
  into `B1` (OP reader section + `emitir`/`cancelar` RPCs + RLS revoke `db/66`),
  `B2` (order detail screen, route `#/ordens-compra/:id`), `B3` (orders list
  screen).
  **Phase `B1` — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-18).** UI reader
  (`buildOrdensReaderSection` in `js/screens/op-nova.js`, commit `b0c3f27`):
  one row per linked order, material—cor · fornecedor · qtd · three dimension
  badges · Emitir/Cancelar admin actions per state, config chip,
  frozen-at-emission note, no receipt inputs, defensive
  extended-select-with-fallback so a pre-`db/65` database never regresses.
  DB half (`db/66_ordem_compra_emitir_cancelar.sql`, commit `5a2cde7`):
  `emitir_ordem_compra_fio`/`cancelar_ordem_compra_fio` RPCs (admin-only,
  fornecedor-assigned precondition on emit, `rascunho`/`emitida` precondition
  on cancel, one `ordem_compra_eventos` row per transition) + partial ACL
  hardening (`REVOKE UPDATE` on `ordens_compra_fio` from `authenticated`,
  restored column-by-column except the three dimension columns — see the
  `KG-RECEBIDO-ACL-GAP` debt below). Verified live in staging
  (`ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`): a scoped `BEGIN…ROLLBACK` matrix re-confirmed both
  RPC branches (null-fornecedor emit → `{ok:false,erro:...}`, row unchanged;
  fornecedor-assigned emit → `{ok:true,...}`, row transitions +
  1 `ordem_compra_eventos` row), then the architect walked both paths live in
  the UI (error path: Emitir on a "— não atribuído" order now shows the error
  toast, row stays Rascunho; success path: Emitir on a fornecedor-seeded order
  succeeds, badge flips to Emitida) — **both confirmed**.
  **`ORDEM-COMPRA-B1-BLOCKED-BY-MCP-AUTH` is RESOLVED** (the `supabase-legacy`
  MCP authenticated this session) — the live-blocker entry below is retired.
  **`ORDEM-COMPRA-B1-UI-RESULT-CHECK` bug found + fixed in this closeout,
  commit `275ede2`:** `emitirOrdemCompra`/`cancelarOrdemCompra`
  (`js/screens/op-nova.js`) checked only `res.error` (transport-level); the
  RPCs return HTTP 200 with `{ok:false,erro:...}` on business-logic rejection,
  so a rejected emit/cancel showed a **false success toast** while the row
  silently stayed unchanged — reproduced live (Emitir on a null-fornecedor
  order showed "success" with no actual DB transition; confirmed via a full
  non-legacy-row scan, 0 rows had ever reached `emitida` with a real
  `emitida_em`/event before the fix) and fixed to also check `res.data.ok`,
  surfacing `res.data.erro` on rejection. **Sweep finding (no systemic
  debt):** every other `supa.rpc(...)` call site in the app either already
  checks `res.data.ok === false` correctly, or calls an RPC with no
  `{ok,erro}` envelope (raises a Postgres exception or returns a scalar), so
  an error-only check is correct there — this was an isolated defect in the
  two new B1 handlers, not a pattern. 2 new render-harness smokes assert the
  error path (rejected emit/cancel → error toast, not the false success
  toast); full suite `132` pre-existing failures unchanged, zero regression.
  **Ratified supplier-assignment decision (2026-07-18, this closeout):**
  fornecedor assignment is a **per-order** property of `ordens_compra_fio`
  (schema already supports it — nullable `fornecedor_id` FK, one row per
  material+color, already the row-level RLS ownership key for
  `ocf_fornecedor_read`/`update` and the `emitir` RPC's own precondition — no
  schema change needed). Assignment **moves to the future `B2` order-detail
  screen**; the OP-screen's legacy fornecedor selects (`buildAtrib` in
  `op-nova.js`, which bulk-assigns one fornecedor per material across an
  entire OP via `atribuirFornecedorFioOp`) are **removed only after `B2` is
  functional** (no assignment-capability gap in between). `op_fornecedores` is
  **kept synchronized as a compatibility projection** — it is not cosmetic:
  `ops_fornecedor_read`/`op_itens_fornecedor_read` RLS key on it for supplier
  visibility, and `screenFornecedorOrdens`'s embedded `ops(numero,ano)` join
  degrades silently without it. **Reassignment after `emitida` is BLOCKED**
  (the correction path is cancel + open a new draft order, not an in-place
  fornecedor swap on an emitted order — keeps the `ordem_compra_eventos` audit
  trail honest). The empty-dropdown bug (`fornecedores.tipo` domain
  `fio_algodao`/`fio_poliester`/`tecelagem`/`latex` vs `ordens_compra_fio.tipo`
  domain `algodao`/`poliester`, collided under the shared variable name `tipo`
  in `buildAtrib`, `op-nova.js:1185-1188`) is **recorded as noted-not-fixed** —
  the selects it affects are slated for removal at `B2`, so patching a
  soon-to-be-deleted code path is not worthwhile.
  **Registered debts (canonical, verbatim):**
  - `ORDEM-COMPRA-B1-KG-RECEBIDO-ACL-GAP` — `kg_recebido` remains directly
    writable by `authenticated` after `db/66` (both
    `registrarRecebimentoOrdemFio`, `op-writes.js:29-43`, and
    `screenFornecedorOrdens`, `fornecedor.js:461-463`, keep writing it
    directly); PostgreSQL column-level `REVOKE` cannot narrow an
    already-existing table-level grant without breaking both live consumers
    with no replacement RPC. **Closes only when Phase C ships the
    ledger-based `registrar_recebimento_ordem_compra_fio` RPC in the same
    migration that revokes `kg_recebido` from `authenticated`.**
  - `SUPPLIER_RECEIPT_WRITE_PATH_DISCOVERED` — `js/screens/fornecedor.js:461`
    (`screenFornecedorOrdens`) is a live, independent supplier-facing direct
    `UPDATE` of `kg_recebido`/`data_recebimento`/`status` on
    `ordens_compra_fio`, gated by `ocf_fornecedor_update` RLS
    (`fornecedor_id = meu_fornecedor_id()`); not mentioned in the spec's §0
    evidenced-inventory (which asserted suppliers have no existing write
    path). Flagged in the spec's provenance trail — **§0 itself is NOT
    rewritten** (the discovery is recorded here and in the ledger, not folded
    into the ratified inventory text).
  - **Phase C scope AMENDED:** the ledger-based
    `registrar_recebimento_ordem_compra_fio` RPC and rewrite must serve
    **both** live consumers — `op-writes.js`'s `registrarRecebimentoOrdemFio`
    **and** `fornecedor.js`'s `screenFornecedorOrdens` (previously scoped only
    around the admin writer) — `screenFornecedorOrdens` must be rewritten to
    call the ledger RPC instead of updating `ordens_compra_fio` directly.
  Phases `B2`/`B3`/`C`/`D`/`E` remain `NOT AUTHORIZED`, each pending its own
  order.**
  `docs/architecture/ORDEM_COMPRA_LIFECYCLE_SPEC_PROPOSED.md`
  (three-dimension model: administrative cycle rascunho/emitida/cancelada,
  acceptance nao_aplicavel/pendente/aceita/rejeitada, receipt derived from a
  new physical-registration ledger; global config `ordem_compra_exige_aceite`
  with a freeze-at-emission rule; production-gate query definition for
  "Iniciar produção") was ratified following an independent read-only
  architecture review that found **one confirmed defect (Finding 1,
  corrected)** — the receipt precondition admitted a `rejeitada` order,
  contradicting the ratified "blocked until `aceita`" rule; corrected to
  `status_aceite IN ('nao_aplicavel','aceita')` in the spec's §4/§6/§7(e).
  **All 7 open decisions (a)-(g) ratified** (full detail in the spec's §11):
  notably (b) admin-accepts-on-supplier's-behalf ratified unconditionally
  (hard dependency until supplier self-service ships), and (f)
  emission-locks-quantities ratified now rather than deferred (changing it
  after Phase B would break the `emitir` RPC contract). **Two new
  implementation gaps accepted and folded into the phasing as binding
  requirements:** Phase A's migration must apply schema + legacy backfill in
  one transaction; Phase B/C must revoke direct `UPDATE` on the four
  dimension-bearing columns from `authenticated` so the `SECURITY DEFINER`
  RPCs are the sole writers (enforced invariant, not convention — the
  `ANON-GRANT-DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH` lesson). **No implementation authorized by
  ratification itself.** Phasing (A schema+config → B panel visibility → C
  receipt rework via the single shared writer → D gate activation → E
  dormant acceptance checkpoint) remains each independently authorizable —
  all phases were `NOT AUTHORIZED` at ratification, pending a separate order
  per phase (**superseded by the `ORDEM-COMPRA SPEC AMENDMENT` above: Phase B
  is now B1/B2/B3 and `B1` is authorized**).
  **Open governance item, unresolved:** no `PURCHASE-ORDER-FOUNDATION-AUDIT`
  document exists anywhere in this repo or its git history (confirmed by
  exhaustive search); the architect is retrieving the original source for
  verbatim persistence as
  `docs/reports/PURCHASE_ORDER_FOUNDATION_AUDIT_R1_2026-07-18.md`, or, if
  unrecoverable, the citation will be corrected to name the architect's
  in-chat authorization directly. Tracked separately from the ratified
  decisions above.
- **`ORDEM-COMPRA-B1-BLOCKED-BY-MCP-AUTH` — `RESOLVED` (2026-07-18).** The
  `supabase-legacy` MCP authenticated this session; the DB half (`db/66`
  RPCs + partial ACL hardening) was already applied to staging in an earlier
  session (commit `5a2cde7`) and is now verified live (matrix re-run +
  architect visual walk — see Phase `B1` closeout above). No longer a live
  blocker.
- **Open architect decisions:** `NONE` blocking. **One non-blocking product
  decision registered (`YARN-MANTER-PEDIDO-REDUNDANCY`, 2026-07-18):** now that
  `Salvar distribuição` exists (save-only), the `Manter pedido` button — also
  save-only, seeding the pedido metrage — may be redundant; **architect to decide
  keep-or-remove.** Not a defect; if removed, foldable into a future
  `YARN-BUTTONS Phase B`. `G28-CAMADA-2` remains `TRACK
  COMPLETE / CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (full `A1-A7` + password policy). Binding launch
  constraints (key regime, launch user model, standing pre-launch items) recorded
  under "Binding decisions in force".
- **Workspace:** `D:\OneDrive\Programação\Ravatex\controle-tapetes-g28`.
  **Branch:** `dev` (created 2026-07-18 from `work/g28-document-qualification`'s
  HEAD `84e2a07`, per `ORDEM-COMPRA-PHASE-A`'s branch discipline — all
  implementation work lands here going forward). **Allowed remote:**
  `production`, `dev` branch only (remote-backup push authorized by
  `ORDEM-COMPRA-PHASE-A`) — `main` remains forbidden; no push to
  `origin`/`staging` without separate express authorization.

## Binding decisions in force

Condensed statements of the rulings that constrain future work. Full recorded
decisions (verbatim) are in `docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md`
(Architect Decision + `PROJECT-STATE-COMPACTION-B` sections) and in
`docs/archive/pt-BR/PROJECT_STATE.md`.

### Pre-migration decisions (`PROJECT-STATE-COMPACTION-B` order, 2026-07-17)

- **Key regime — new format (binding):** the new project standardizes on the
  **new-format keys** (`sb_publishable_…` + a matching secret key). No legacy
  `anon`/`service_role` JWTs. The regime is applied consistently across
  `js/config.js`, `scripts/backup/*`, `scripts/staging/*`, the Ingestor (both the
  in-repo `services/documents-ingestor/` copy and the standalone twin at
  `D:\OneDrive\Programação\Ravatex\documents-ingestor\`), and the asserting tests.
  **The secret key never appears in chat or the repo** — `supabase secrets` /
  Vercel env / GitHub Actions secrets only.
- **Launch user model — full-trust admins only (binding):** **no `somente_leitura`
  admin may be created in production** until `A2-SERVER-SIDE-ENFORCEMENT` closes.
  The constraint **is** the mitigation — the underlying risk is unchanged; exposure
  is zero **only while the constraint holds**. Consequently
  `A2-SERVER-SIDE-ENFORCEMENT` and `A2-CREATE-NIVEL-ACESSO-WIRING` rank **FIRST-WEEK**
  (not before-first-user) in the residual risk register.
- **Standing PRE-LAUNCH items (ratified from the diagnosis):** `DELETE-PROD-GUARD-A`;
  the backup trigger via **GitHub Actions** + the **`BK7` restore runbook**; and the
  **auth-restore rehearsal into a throwaway Supabase project before `M3`**. These are
  the before-first-user set the architect holds standing; the register's other
  before-first-user framings are advisory.

### Migration governance

- **`PRODUCTION-READINESS-DIAGNOSIS-R1` — `ACCEPTED` / ratified reference report
  (2026-07-17):** `docs/reports/PRODUCTION_READINESS_DIAGNOSIS_R1_2026-07-17.md`. Its
  residual risk register (12 items) is canonical; its `M0`-`M10` plan is the active
  track. Read-only — authorizes no implementation by itself.
- **Amended publication criterion (2026-07-17 — supersedes
  `G28-GOVERNANCE-CONSOLIDATION-A`):** publication **proceeds with Camada 3 at
  `BK4.2`** (exporter proven + restore-smoke passed); remaining Camada-3 scope + the
  two ex-asterisks (`A2-SERVER-SIDE-ENFORCEMENT`, `A2-CREATE-NIVEL-ACESSO-WIRING`)
  become `POST-LAUNCH DEBT` with production consequences. The reviewer objection
  (minimum pre-launch set) is **recorded and overruled** — the architect decides which
  items close before cutover. The superseded original (`both` Camada-2 and full
  Camada-3 CLOSED in staging) is preserved verbatim in the archive
  (`PROJECT-STATE-COMPACTION-B` batch); in any wording divergence, the archive wins.
- **`BACKLOG FREEZE` (2026-07-17) — `LIFTED` at `M10` (2026-07-18):** while in force,
  no NEW fronts were authorizable until after cutover; only the `M0`-`M10` plan and the
  residual register survived. Cutover (`M10`) is done, so the freeze is **lifted** and
  new fronts are authorizable again, each by its own order — see "Active phase" and the
  `POST-LAUNCH DEBT REGISTER`.
- **Canon correction (2026-07-17):** branch `work/g28-document-qualification` commit
  count was **749** at diagnosis time (not "~555"); **753** at the `M0` push
  (2026-07-17, 4 subsequent docs commits) — see `M0` record below.
- **`M0` (new repo landing) — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17, single-use push
  authorization):** full-history push, no force/tags, HEAD `7b2ab7d7aaca44edf27
  81b24eb5aeecf8ba63c50` (**753** commits) → `inttexsystem/inttracker`, branch
  mapping `work/g28-document-qualification:main`. Pre-flight: clean tree; sensitive
  paths ignored (`supabase/.temp`, `.ravatex-local`, `backups`; `.mcp.json` absent
  from the tree entirely — not a gap); tracked-file secrets sweep clean (`sb_secret`/
  `service_role`/connection-string patterns — one doc hit was a `[SENHA]` placeholder;
  the only `eyJ` hits are the pre-existing public `anon`-role keys in `js/config.js`,
  by design RLS-gated, not a secret). Destination confirmed empty before push
  (`git fetch`/`ls-remote` → no branches). Post-push: `git rev-list --left-right
  --count production/main...HEAD` = **`0 0`** (exact match). New remote `production`
  = `https://github.com/inttexsystem/inttracker.git` (fetch+push). `origin`
  (`grupoterrabranca/controle-tapetes`) and `staging`
  (`ravatexapps-dotcom/controle-tapetes-staging`) **retained, unchanged** — `staging`
  is now historical backup only, no longer a push target.
- **`M1` (new Supabase project verification + sanction) — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`
  (2026-07-17, read-only verification + docs record):** confirmed, via the
  read-only Supabase MCP pinned to `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk`, the project is virgin:
  **0 tables in `public`**, **0 rows in the migrations registry**
  (`list_migrations`), **0 storage buckets** (`storage.buckets` count and row
  listing both `0`); `auth` scaffolding present and unmodified (**23 base tables**,
  all `0` rows except `auth.schema_migrations`'s stock seed rows); `storage`
  schema carries only its own stock scaffolding (8 tables, no buckets/objects).
  **Identification evidence:** `claude mcp list` shows the configured connection
  URL as `https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp?project_ref=gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk&features=
  database&read_only=true` — this **directly pins both the project ref and the
  `read_only=true` flag in the MCP's own connection string**, a stronger
  confirmation than the order anticipated (the order allowed for config-plus-
  empty-profile as the only available evidence; the ref is in fact directly
  readable from the MCP configuration, not just inferred). No write attempted;
  no table/migration/bucket found — no HARD STOP triggered. **Boundary amendment
  (this order, binding):** the staging-only boundary below is **amended** —
  writes to `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk` are authorized **only within explicitly
  ordered `M`-track phases** (`M2`, `M3`, `M4`, `M9`); `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`
  becomes **read-only legacy** (the `M3` exporter/export-read path is the
  named exception); production `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` **remains PROHIBITED**,
  untouched. **Next authorizable action:** `M2`, own order.
- **`M2` (schema replay into the sanctioned target) — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`
  (2026-07-17):** the ratified authoritative source (repo `db/`, ordered
  `db/01→db/64`, skip `*.verify.sql`; `setup_completo.sql`/`supabase db push`
  forbidden) was replayed into `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk` one migration at a time via
  MCP `apply_migration`, each registered under its canonical file-stem name, verified
  after each — **64/64 applied, zero errors, no skip/patch/reorder.** **HARD STOP ZERO
  passed** (ref pinned + virgin 0/0/0 pre-state). **Post-replay gate:** (4a) registry
  = **64 entries, order `01→64`, canonical names**; (4c) ACL spot-checks faithful —
  `is_admin_full`/backup-writer RPCs (`db/64`)/evidence-writer (`db/49`) = service_role
  only, document-scan RPCs (`db/38`) = authenticated (admin-gated internally), and
  `is_admin()` broad (PUBLIC/anon/authenticated/service_role) is the **pre-existing
  `IS-ADMIN-ACL-REVIEW` debt reproduced faithfully**, not a new defect; (4d, corrected
  gate) sole residual = **`parametros_largura`=2** (width-calc **configuration** from
  `db/04`, kept by `db/10`/`db/11`) — every `db/04` **test** cadastro wiped by `db/10`
  (confirmed 0), no genuine test data survived, nothing deleted; (4e) storage buckets
  = 0. **New-project profile:** 40 public tables, 0 views, 53 functions, 67 RLS
  policies, 9 triggers. **Data-writing ruling (architect):** faithful `01→64`
  authorized, gate 4d corrected from "all 0" to "residual matches the faithful replay,
  reported per table with origin" (the classifier initially blocked the `db/04` seed;
  the architect ruled Option 1). **`M2` verification report:**
  `docs/reports/M2_SCHEMA_REPLAY_VERIFICATION_2026-07-17.md`. **Open item (4b, parity
  vs staging): NOT EXECUTABLE** — the reconnected management-scoped MCP credential is
  permission-denied on `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`; the parity diff must be run out-of-band
  or the token re-scoped (advisory, non-blocking). **No production access; staging
  only read-attempted for parity (denied), never written.** Next: `M3`.
- **`M3` (production data migration) — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17):** production
  data copied from legacy `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo` into `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk`.
  **Verification (re-confirmed live at closeout):** auth remap — 24 rows, single
  column (`document_scan_requests.requested_by_user_id`), all remapped to the single
  surviving admin account; FK integrity — dynamic per-constraint orphan scan, **76
  relationships checked, 0 orphans** (13 reference `auth.users` directly, all clean);
  sequence resync — **10/10** populated sequences match `MAX(id)` of their owning
  table exactly. **Exclusion set (test/synthetic data, by design):** `clientes`(2),
  `fornecedores`(1), `lotes`(8), `op_fornecedores`(2), `op_itens`(2), `ops`(6),
  `ordens_compra_fio`(8), `precos_terceirizada`(1), `usuarios`/`auth.users`(9),
  `pedidos`(3), `pedido_itens`(2), `op_eventos`(1), `document_candidates`(3) — not
  carried over; the new database is intentionally smaller than legacy, not
  incompletely migrated. **Architect ruling (a) — `usuarios_eventos` excluded
  entirely (binding):** remapping `ator_id` would fabricate audit history (actors
  who never performed those actions in the new project); legacy retains the
  original 9-row trail as the historical record, the new project's audit trail
  starts empty and truthful from cutover. Same reasoning extends to
  `document_link_revisions`/`document_link_revision_ops` (8/10 rows, also
  actor-keyed canonical history) — excluded for the identical reason. **Architect
  ruling (b) — `parametros_largura` overwritten from legacy (binding):** the `db/04`
  seed (`peso_linear` 1.5000/2.2500, `valor_x` 1.0000) is a bootstrap default; the
  legacy live-tuned configuration (`largura=1.40`→`peso_linear=0.3360`,
  `algodao_por_ml=0.226000`, `poliester_por_ml=0.110000`, `valor_x=0.5000`;
  `largura=2.10`→`peso_linear=0.5370`, `algodao_por_ml=0.366000`,
  `poliester_por_ml=0.171000`, `valor_x=0.5000`) is real operationally-tuned data by
  the same standard as `clientes`/`modelos` and supersedes the seed — applied via
  `UPDATE` against `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk`, matched by `largura`, this closeout.
  **Legacy retention (binding):** `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo` retains the original audit
  trail (`usuarios_eventos`/`document_link_revisions`/`document_link_revision_ops`)
  and the excluded test/synthetic rows above — it is the historical record for both
  and **must not be deleted or pruned without a separate, explicit architect
  decision.** Full detail: `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` `M3-DATA` entry. **No
  production access; legacy read-only, no writes.** Next: `M4`.
- **`M8` (Documents Ingestor repoint) — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-18, executed out
  of numeric sequence by direct architect order):** configuration phase — the two
  Ingestor installations (in-repo `services/documents-ingestor/` + standalone
  operational twin at `D:\OneDrive\Programação\Ravatex\documents-ingestor\`, the copy
  the `Ravatex-DocumentScanWatcher-Staging` scheduled task runs) were repointed from
  legacy `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo` to `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk`. **Surfaces changed:** both
  `.env` (URL + `PROJECT_REF` → new; `SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` → new-format `sb_secret_` key
  pasted by the architect, never seen/logged/committed by Claude; twin's Google creds
  preserved), both `Start-DocumentScanWatcher.ps1` guards (`$ExpectedProjectRef` → new,
  else the watcher self-refuses to start), both `SUPABASE_WRITER_RUNBOOK.md` (reworded
  to "Sanctioned Target Project Only", cutover-durable). Hermetic tests referencing the
  legacy ref left untouched (fixtures, `§20`). **Schema compatibility verified live**
  (read-only): every table/RPC the Ingestor writes exists in the new project with the
  right `service_role` grants. **Repoint verified by a real watcher cycle:** the
  Ingestor authenticated to the new project with the new key and all five writes landed
  (request `f3c3647e` + scan run `e9287e0e`), zero schema-cache/missing-RPC errors — but
  the Gmail scan failed at `invalid_grant` (expired Google OAuth token, 0 documents), so
  the full Gmail→Drive→DB document demonstration is **deferred**
  (`INGESTOR-DOC-CYCLE-VERIFY-DEFERRED`, gated on token refresh, tied to
  `CAMADA3-OAUTH-GRANT-COUPLING`). **Two order claims corrected against live evidence,
  both architect-withdrawn:** the named CI file `.github/workflows/ingestor-ci.yml` does
  not exist (nothing deleted); the `document_scan_runs` anon-INSERT hole
  (`PRODUCTION-SECURITY-01`) was disproven live and not registered — the real finding is
  `ANON-GRANT-DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH` (27 non-document tables, registered). **Drive/OAuth
  unchanged** (ruling #4). **No Supabase writes issued by Claude** (the watcher wrote via
  the Ingestor's own service_role key; all Claude MCP calls read-only); **no production
  access; no push.** Full detail: `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md` `M8` entry. Next: `M4`
  (or any `M5`-`M10`), plus the deferred doc-cycle verification.
- **`M4` (Edge Functions + secrets) — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-18, recorded at
  `M10` closeout as an accomplished fact):** the five admin Edge Functions were
  **deployed to `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk` by the architect**, with the per-function
  secrets set (new-format key regime). Deploy performed out-of-band (Supabase
  dashboard / CLI); no repo commit is the deploy artifact. Confirmed working in
  production reality (the live app exercises them). Not executed by Claude.
- **`M5` (client config repoint) — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-18):** `js/config.js`
  repointed to the new project — commit `75c4ab6` ("Repoint config to new Supabase
  project"), then the **environment split restored** (commit `1e17087`, "Restore
  environment split in config") so host detection routes production vs. development
  correctly, and the environment banner fixed (commit `f369964`). New-format
  publishable key in committed config (RLS-gated, public by design). On `production/main`.
- **`M6` (Vercel wiring) — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-18):** repo linked to Vercel,
  static deployment configured (commits `5416128` "Trigger first Vercel deploy",
  `aa77612` "Configure Vercel static deployment"); the app is **live and serving** at
  `inttracker-jade.vercel.app`. A **Root Directory defect** was found during wiring and
  **cleared** (the deploy now serves the repo root correctly). Executed by the architect.
- **`M7` (smoke verification) — `SUPERSEDED BY REALITY` (2026-07-18):** no separate
  scoped smoke phase was executed. It is superseded by the fact that the system is
  **live and serving in production** (`inttracker-jade.vercel.app`) — login, pedido
  load, and the admin surfaces are exercised by real use. Recorded honestly as
  not-run-as-scoped, replaced by the live-serving reality; **not** a fabricated smoke
  closeout.
- **`M9` (backup repoint + first real run) — `SUPERSEDED BY REALITY` /
  `NOT EXECUTED AS SCOPED` (2026-07-18):** the production backup mechanism (repoint
  `PG*`/`SUPABASE_*` to the new project + a first real scheduled run) was **never
  stood up**. The exporter was proven once, manually, against staging at `BK4.2`; no
  production repoint, no automated trigger, no first production run. Folded into the
  `CAMADA3 BK5-BK8` post-launch debt — see the debt register (**no proven production
  backup exists**). Recorded honestly; no fabricated run.
- **`M10` (cutover) — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-18):** the primary URL is Vercel
  (`inttracker-jade.vercel.app`), the system is live against `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk`
  with real use. This closeout order records the accomplished cutover, marks the
  `G28-MIGRATION-TRACK` `COMPLETE / CLOSED`, and **lifts the backlog freeze**.
  Docs-only; the cutover itself was performed by the architect.
- **Staging-only execution boundary (`STAGING-ONLY-EXECUTION-BOUNDARY-A`,
  2026-07-15, partially superseded):** operational environment is staging
  `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo`; the protected project `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` is `OUT OF
  SCOPE`, **never accessed** — this don't-touch rule stays fully in force. Its
  "Vercel not selected" / production-postponement items are **superseded** by the
  amended criterion + active `M0`-`M10` track (target = the new
  `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk`, not the protected project). **Further amended by `M1`
  (2026-07-17):** `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo` is now **read-only legacy** (writes
  authorized only for the named `M`-track phases against `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk`);
  the `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` don't-touch rule is unaffected. Full original in the
  archive.

### Standing product / process rulings

- **`G28-CAMADA-3` status:** at `BK4.2` — `BK4.1` (`backup_runs` schema, `d39a848`)
  and `BK4.2` (exporter, `4831ca3` + fixes; real staging run
  `ae55e714-…`, bundle `83378` bytes, restore-smoke 63/63 tables incl.
  `auth.identities=8`) both `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` in staging. Remaining subphases +
  trigger are `POST-LAUNCH DEBT`. A live `CAMADA3-OAUTH-GRANT-COUPLING` debt is
  registered (see below). Full BK narrative archived; contract at
  `docs/architecture/CAMADA3_BACKUP_CONTRACT.md`.
- **`G28-CAMADA-2` classification — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`, track `COMPLETE`
  (2026-07-17):** entered classified `PRE-EXISTING PARTIAL CAPABILITY + FULL SCOPE
  A1-A7 DEFERRED` (`G28-RECONCILIATION-DECISIONS-A`); exits `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` with
  full `A1-A7` + password policy delivered. Functional reference during the build:
  `D:\OneDrive\Programação\SGAA_clean_baseline`. Full narrative archived.
- **`G28-C`:** `CLOSED / TECHNICALLY ACCEPTED — ARCHITECT PRODUCT VALIDATION PENDING`;
  `G28-B8` `SUBSUMED BY G28-C`.
- **`PROJECT-CONTROL-BASELINE-R1` (ChatGPT):** `REJECTED / NOT RATIFIED`, superseded by
  `BACKLOG-RECONCILIATION-READONLY-R1` (the adopted reference baseline).
- **Supervision governance:** state/authorizations/phases held by Claude (chat) +
  Claude Code (resident); ChatGPT is a process consultant **without state custody or
  authority to issue orders**. `docs/governance/SUPERVISION_PROTOCOL.md` requires a
  `STRUCTURAL POLICY COMPLIANCE` section in every implementation phase report.
- **Admin password auto-reset BLOCKED (`A5.1-A5.2`):** an admin cannot reset their own
  password (`SELF_RESET_FORBIDDEN`) — they use the self-service change flow (`A4.2`).
- **User audit trail design (`A6.1`/`A6.1-B`/`A6.2`, canonical):**
  `public.usuarios_eventos` has two mutually-exclusive write paths keyed on
  `auth.uid()` — `trg_usuario_evento` (`db/60`, authenticated-admin `UPDATE`s) and the
  five admin Edge Functions (`service_role`, explicit). Both fill the `db/61` identity
  snapshot; `usuario_id` is `ON DELETE SET NULL` so events survive delete. Detail:
  `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` §4.
- **`UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX` — OPEN active regression (register #9):** `js/ui.js`'s
  `el()` sets boolean attrs unconditionally, so `disabled`/`checked` `false` still
  render true; `admin-usuarios.js`'s Excluir button still carries the pattern
  (suspect). Not yet fixed. Full narrative archived.
- **`UI-SURFACE-DUPLICATION` — standing LESSON (registered 2026-07-18, from the
  `YARN-BUTTONS` regression saga):** UI position in an order must be specified by
  **named block/screen**, never by relative reference ("the primary button", "the
  footer"); and every UI order must require verifying **ALL surfaces that render the
  component**. This app has documented modal duplication — the Tecelagem
  distribution/acceptance UI renders on the **OP screen** (`op-nova.js`) and the
  **Pedido hub** (`pedido-detail-events.js`); before the shared-builder
  consolidation, a single-surface edit silently left the twin stale (a removed
  button kept "reappearing"). The consolidation into
  `js/screens/op-distribuicao-ui.js` (`buildDistribuicaoBlock` +
  `buildIniciarProducaoButton`, consumed by both) removed that specific
  duplication; the lesson stands for any future shared UI component.
- **`TEST-MOCK-FIDELITY-AUDIT` — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` (2026-07-17):** zero confirmed (c)
  blind doubles; `tests/_doubles.js` `APPROVED`, `§20` added to `CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md`,
  lots `L1`/`L2` `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`. Report
  `docs/reports/TEST_MOCK_FIDELITY_AUDIT_2026-07-17.md`; full narrative archived.
- **Controlled Delete × document history:** physical deletion of Pedido/OP is blocked
  when canonical document history exists (`document_link_revisions`/
  `document_link_revision_ops`, append-only); permanent contract in
  `docs/architecture/PEDIDO_OP_SCHEMA_CONTRACT.md`.
- **Language policy:** English for canonical docs/reports/new code + commit messages;
  pt-BR for UI text; architect orders may be issued in Portuguese, recorded in English
  (original preserved in ledger/archive); phase IDs never translated. Homes:
  `DOCUMENTATION_MODEL.md` §18, `CODE_HEALTH_RULES.md` §19, `SUPERVISION_PROTOCOL.md`

## POST-LAUNCH DEBT REGISTER (consolidated + ranked at `M10`, 2026-07-18)

The system is live; every item below is `POST-LAUNCH DEBT`, `NOT AUTHORIZED` until its
own order. Ranked by **production consequence** (1 = most consequential). This single
list supersedes the former "residual risk register (12 items)" and the scattered
per-entry debts; the detailed narratives for each remain in their own bullets further
down this section and in the ledger/archive.

1. **`INGESTOR-DOC-CYCLE-VERIFY-DEFERRED` — `ACTIVE PRODUCTION BLOCKER`.** The
   Ingestor's Google OAuth token is expired (`invalid_grant`); **no documents are
   entering the live system.** Fix: refresh the token (interactive Google login —
   architect action), seed a fresh scan request, run one watcher cycle, confirm a real
   document lands with its Drive file resolving. Coupled to #7 (same OAuth client).
2. **`CAMADA3 BK5-BK8` — no proven production backup.** The exporter is manual and was
   proven only once, in staging (`BK4.2`); `M9` (production backup repoint + first real
   run) was never executed. No automated trigger, no retention, no restore runbook/drill
   against production. **A live system with no backup safety net.** Includes the former
   `CAMADA3-TRIGGER-SELECTION` (mechanism resolved: GitHub Actions).
3. **`DELETE-PROD-GUARD-A` — destructive-delete guard not deployed to production.**
   Data-loss exposure: the delete-guard for Pedido/OP was not repointed/installed on the
   live project.
4. **`A2-SERVER-SIDE-ENFORCEMENT` — privilege escalation, mitigated by a binding
   constraint.** RLS/Edge Functions key on `usuarios.tipo` only;
   `nivel_acesso='somente_leitura'` is client-side, bypassable from a `tipo='admin'`
   JWT. **Binding mitigation in force: no `somente_leitura` admin may exist in
   production until this closes** — the constraint IS the mitigation; exposure is zero
   only while it holds.
5. **`A2-CREATE-NIVEL-ACESSO-WIRING` — companion to #4.** `admin-create-user`'s fixed
   column list drops `nivel_acesso` (new admins land `completo`); needs an Edge Function
   change. Moot at launch only under #4's constraint.
6. **`ANON-GRANT-DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH` — grants/policies disagree (not a live hole).** 27
   non-document tables carry raw `anon INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` grants, inert only because
   RLS policies evaluate false for anon. No second line of defence. Distinct from #8
   (table-grant scope vs anchor-function ACL) — not merged.
7. **`CAMADA3-OAUTH-GRANT-COUPLING` — cross-subsystem SPOF (latent).** The backup
   exporter reuses the Ingestor's OAuth client; rotating/revoking it silently breaks
   backups. Interacts directly with #1 (refreshing the token to unblock ingestion
   touches the shared grant). Decide: formalize the reuse or build a separate client.
8. **`IS-ADMIN-ACL-REVIEW` — over-broad `EXECUTE` on `public.is_admin()`** (granted to
   `PUBLIC`/`anon`/`authenticated`/`service_role`). Not a live exposure (`is_admin()` is
   false for anon); tightening touches every RLS policy that calls it. Needs its own
   read-only diagnosis.
9. **`CODE-HEALTH-AUDIT-§18-R1` — accumulated small code-health debts** (dead
   `cadastrosModalGrid` helper; `tests/auth.smoke.js` stale `<script>` regex;
   `admin-usuarios-modal.js` at 576 lines; `tec-to-acabamento-flow` 2 stale static-slice
   assertions; legacy `docs/AI_AGENT_RULES.md` review). Also tracks `UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX`
   (active regression in `js/ui.js` `el()`).
10. **`TEST-MOCK-FIDELITY` — remaining lots** beyond `L1`/`L2` (audit `CLOSED`, `§20`
    added; residual lots not yet done).
11. **`UI-FIXED-FORMAT-COLUMN-WIDTHS`** — CNPJ/date/phone column wrap (cosmetic).
12. **`UI-ACTION-BUTTON` lot 3** — `cadastros.js` action-button pass (cosmetic, frozen).
13. **`MODAL-BUTTON-CSS-CHECK`** — modal button CSS review (cosmetic, frozen candidate).
14. **Two stale git-worktree registrations** (`tapetes-baseline-check`,
    `baseline-check-a34`) — prunable, auto-prune blocked by an OneDrive/AV lock;
    housekeeping only, no commit impact. Await one authorized `git worktree prune`.

**Registered for review (`M10`, read-only — do not delete):** an unaccounted branch
`v0/administrativointtex-9166-cf89b1d8` exists on the `production` remote. **Investigated
read-only:** it points at our own commit `75c4ab6` ("Repoint config to new Supabase
project"), has **zero commits not already in `production/main`** (`git rev-list
--left-right --count production/main...` = `5 0`), and is a **strict ancestor of
`main`** — i.e. an older snapshot of this same branch's history, not foreign content.
Consistent with a Vercel/v0 import artifact (a branch auto-created at the commit that was
HEAD when the repo was connected). No code review concern; safe to leave or delete at the
architect's discretion.
- **`NOT AUTHORIZED` candidate fronts (freeze `LIFTED` at `M10` — now authorizable by
  their own orders, still `NOT AUTHORIZED` until ordered):** `CODE-HEALTH-AUDIT-§18-R1`;
  `PUBLICATION-TRACK-REVIEW`; `UI-EL-BOOLEAN-ATTR-FIX` (`ACTIVE REGRESSION`, not fixed);
  `G28-D` publication (largely realized by the `M0`-`M10` cutover);
  `DEPLOYMENT_MAPPING_AND_PRODUCTION_MIGRATION_PROCEDURE` (superseded by `M0`-`M10`);
  `DELETE-PROD-GUARD-A`; `DELETE-AUDIT-LOG-A`; `G28-CAMADA-4`; `A4.3` (email/SMTP
  invites); `ORDEM-COMPRA-LIFECYCLE` Phases `B2`-`E` (spec `RATIFIED` + `AMENDED`
  2026-07-18, Phases `A` and `B1` `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`; Phases
  `B2`-`E` still `NOT AUTHORIZED` — see
  `docs/architecture/ORDEM_COMPRA_LIFECYCLE_SPEC_PROPOSED.md`).
  Ranked items also appear in the `POST-LAUNCH DEBT REGISTER` above.
- **`CAMADA3-TRIGGER-SELECTION` — `NOT AUTHORIZED` (`BK3`; register #3):** the
  automated-backup scheduler; mechanism resolved — **GitHub Actions, not Vercel cron**
  (the exporter shells out to `pg_dump`/`psql`). Contract:
  `docs/architecture/CAMADA3_BACKUP_CONTRACT.md`.
- **`CAMADA3-OAUTH-GRANT-COUPLING` — `NOT AUTHORIZED`, live debt (`BK4.2`,
  2026-07-17; register #4):** the exporter's first real run used the **Documents
  Ingestor's own OAuth client** (confirmed via Google's `tokeninfo`), not a dedicated
  grant; rotating/revoking that grant would also break backups. Decision: formalize
  the reuse (contract §4) or build a separate client. Detail:
  `docs/architecture/CAMADA3_BACKUP_CONTRACT.md` §4 amendment.
- **`CAMADA3-DRIVE-ACTIVATION` — partially exercised, `NOT AUTHORIZED` as a standing
  capability (`BK4.2`):** one real manual `google_drive` upload succeeded in staging
  (`ae55e714-…`); not yet repeated/scheduled/production-standing.
- **`A2-SERVER-SIDE-ENFORCEMENT` (#1) + `A2-CREATE-NIVEL-ACESSO-WIRING` (#5) —
  `NOT AUTHORIZED`, `POST-LAUNCH DEBT` / FIRST-WEEK:** RLS and the admin Edge
  Functions key exclusively on `usuarios.tipo`; `nivel_acesso='somente_leitura'` is
  client-side only, bypassable via direct API from a `tipo='admin'` JWT;
  `is_admin_full()` (`db/62`) exists and is unused; `admin-create-user`'s fixed
  column list drops `nivel_acesso` (new admins land `completo`; wiring needs an Edge
  Function change). **Both moot at launch** under the full-trust-admins-only
  constraint (no `somente_leitura` admin in production until #1 closes).
- **`IS-ADMIN-ACL-REVIEW` — `NOT AUTHORIZED` (registered `A2.1-B`, 2026-07-17;
  register #6):** `public.is_admin()` grants `EXECUTE` to
  `PUBLIC`/`anon`/`authenticated`/`service_role` — broader than the db/54/57
  least-privilege standard; tightening touches every RLS policy that calls it, so it
  needs its own read-only diagnosis. Not a current exposure (`is_admin()` is `false`
  for anon via `auth.uid()`).
- **`ANON-GRANT-DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH` — `NOT AUTHORIZED`, first-week debt (registered
  `M8`, 2026-07-18):** in `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk` (verified live, read-only), **27
  non-document `public` tables** carry raw table-level `anon`
  `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` grants (`clientes`, `cores`, `entregas`, `entrega_itens`,
  `expedicoes`, `expedicao_itens`, `expedicao_movimentos`, `expedicao_movimento_itens`,
  `fornecedores`, `lotes`, `modelos`, `op_eventos`, `op_fornecedores`, `op_itens`,
  `op_latex_entregas`, `op_numeros`, `ops`, `ordens_compra_fio`, `parametros_largura`,
  `pedidos`, `pedido_itens`, `pedido_cliente_eventos`, `pedido_eventos`,
  `pedido_parciais`, `pedido_parcial_itens`, `precos_terceirizada`, `saldo_fios`,
  `saldo_fios_op`, `usuarios` — RLS enabled on all). **Not a live hole:** every write
  is blocked today because the effective policies gate on
  `is_admin()`/`meu_fornecedor_id()`/`meu_cliente_id()`, all of which evaluate
  false/null for an unauthenticated `anon` session. The defect is that grants and
  policies disagree: a table whose safety rests entirely on policy correctness has no
  second line of defence — a future policy edit that widens a `USING`/`WITH CHECK`
  clause would immediately become an anon write path. **Pre-existing, faithfully
  migrated** from the `db/*` grant statements (same origin as the schema replay), not
  introduced by any `M`-track phase. Fix (its own future order): revoke the anon DML
  grants so grants agree with policies; verify the admin/cliente/fornecedor RLS paths
  still function. **Related to but distinct from `IS-ADMIN-ACL-REVIEW`** (that concerns
  the `is_admin()` anchor function's own `EXECUTE` ACL; this concerns table-level DML
  grants) — cross-referenced, **not merged**. The `document_*` family does **not**
  share this shape (checked: RLS on, `is_admin()`-gated, zero anon grants), so there is
  no document-side sibling. Discovered during the `M8` sibling sweep after the
  originally-suspected `document_scan_runs` anon-INSERT premise was disproven live
  (that premise was withdrawn; `PRODUCTION-SECURITY-01` was not registered).
- **`INGESTOR-DOC-CYCLE-VERIFY-DEFERRED` — `NOT AUTHORIZED`, follow-up (registered
  `M8`, 2026-07-18):** `M8` proved the Ingestor repoint at the Supabase layer (new
  `sb_secret_` key auth + schema compatibility + five real writes landed in
  `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk` — request `f3c3647e` + scan run `e9287e0e`, both finalized
  `failed`), but the full Gmail→Drive→DB document cycle did **not** complete: the real
  scan failed at `invalid_grant` (expired Google OAuth token, 0 documents). Deferred
  by architect decision (M8 close, 2026-07-18). To close: refresh the Google OAuth
  token (interactive login — architect action, coupled to
  `CAMADA3-OAUTH-GRANT-COUPLING`, same client the backup exporter reuses), seed one
  fresh `document_scan_requests` row (the migrated one was consumed as `failed` during
  verification), run the watcher once, and confirm a real document lands with its Drive
  file resolving. Tie to `CAMADA3-OAUTH-GRANT-COUPLING`.
- **Small code-health debts (frozen, folded into `CODE-HEALTH-AUDIT-§18-R1`):**
  `cadastrosModalGrid` dead helper; `tests/auth.smoke.js` outdated `<script>` regex
  (6 tests); `admin-usuarios-modal.js` at 576 lines; `tec-to-acabamento-flow`'s 2
  stale static-slice assertions; legacy `docs/AI_AGENT_RULES.md` review.
- **Stale git-worktree registrations (2, `NOT AUTHORIZED` cleanup):**
  `tapetes-baseline-check` + `baseline-check-a34` (missing `gitdir`, prunable;
  auto-prune blocked by an OneDrive/AV `Permission denied` lock — harmless, no commit
  impact). Await one authorized `git worktree prune`.
- **Open non-blocking debts:** `AUTHENTICATED_BROWSER_SMOKE_NOT_EXECUTED`/`…_BLOCKED_BY_TOOLING`;
  `DB30_NOT_RECORDED_IN_SUPABASE_MIGRATION_HISTORY` (applied+verified in staging, no
  drift); production application of the staging-only stack (`db/12`/`21`/`30`/`49`–`57`).
- **UI tracks — `CLOSED / ACCEPTED` in their authorized scope, full narratives
  archived:** `UI-ACTION-BUTTON` (phases i/ii, lots 1/2 + `UI-USERS-GRID-TEXT-
  OVERFLOW`; lot 3 `cadastros.js` frozen; frozen candidates `MODAL-BUTTON-CSS-CHECK`,
  `fornecedor.js` redesign) and `UI-GRID-TEXT-OVERFLOW` (contract + helper + Lots
  A/B/C; frozen candidate `UI-FIXED-FORMAT-COLUMN-WIDTHS` — §7 CNPJ/date/phone column
  wrap; `UI-DOCUMENTOS-RECEBIDOS-LAYOUT-FIX` already `CLOSED / ACCEPTED`, `90726dd`).
- **Test baseline (RESOLVED, historical):** the "~87 / 11 failures" figures were
  stale artifacts (fixed-port `:8765` + removed inline `<script>` assertions), fixed
  by `L2` (`2c9a4c2`). Full note archived.

## Environment and worktree standing facts

- **PRODUCTION (live since `M10`, 2026-07-18):** Supabase `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk`
  ("Inttex"), served by **Vercel at `inttracker-jade.vercel.app`** from
  `inttexsystem/inttracker` (`main`). Schema (`db/01→64`), migrated data, deployed Edge
  Functions, repointed `js/config.js`, and the repointed Ingestor are all in place.
- **DEVELOPMENT / legacy:** `ucrjtfswnfdlxwtmxnoo` — **retained, now the development
  database** (formerly "staging"; the historical record for the excluded audit
  trails/test rows per `M3`). **Protected/other:** `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew` remains
  `PROHIBITED` and **unused — never accessed** in this entire chain.
- **Migration path (all phases recorded under "Migration governance"):** `M0` full-history
  push; `M2` schema replay (64 registry entries, 40 public tables / 53 functions / 67
  policies / 9 triggers / 0 views / 0 buckets); `M3` data migration (auth remap 24
  rows/1 column, FK 76/76 clean, sequences 10/10, `parametros_largura` from legacy);
  `M4` Edge Functions deployed; `M5` `js/config.js` repointed + environment split
  restored (`75c4ab6`/`1e17087`/`f369964`); `M6` Vercel static deploy live
  (`5416128`/`aa77612`, Root Directory defect cleared); `M8` Ingestor repointed;
  `M10` cutover. `M7`/`M9` `SUPERSEDED BY REALITY`. **Supabase MCP:** still
  management-scoped/write-capable from `M2`/`M3` — **standing reminder: flip back to
  read-only.**
- **Remotes:** `production` = `https://github.com/inttexsystem/inttracker.git`
  (fetch+push, added at `M0`); `origin` = `grupoterrabranca/controle-tapetes`;
  `staging` = `ravatexapps-dotcom/controle-tapetes-staging` (historical backup only,
  no longer a push target). All three present on the local repo; no branch other than
  `main` pushed to `production`.
- **MCP (new project):** Supabase MCP is configured and verified against
  `gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk`, **read-only**, its token held **outside the repo**
  (`PROJECT-STATE-COMPACTION-B`, 2026-07-17). **`M1` confirmed directly** (not just
  by profile inference): `claude mcp list` reports the connection URL
  `https://mcp.supabase.com/mcp?project_ref=gqmpsxkxynrjvidfmojk&features=database&
  read_only=true`, pinning both the ref and the read-only flag in the MCP's own
  configuration string. Read-only introspection of the new project is available;
  no write path is authorized outside a specific `M2`-`M10` order.
- **Publication provider:** **Vercel — LIVE** (`inttracker-jade.vercel.app`) since the
  `M10` cutover (2026-07-18). GitHub Pages is no longer the production provider.
- **Branch commit count:** `work/g28-document-qualification` = **753** commits
  (749 at diagnosis time + 4 docs commits; pushed to `production/main` at `M0`).
- **Migrations 49 and 50 (and the staging-only stack):** applied and verified in
  staging; not applied in production by this chain.
- **Worktree topology:** `controle-tapetes-g28` is a linked worktree of
  `controle-tapetes/.git` (alongside `-g27`, `-controlled-delete-gate`, and main
  `work/app-next` — divergent from `staging/work/app-next` and dirty). Two stale
  registrations remain (see "Live debts").
- **Push:** the `M0` push to `production` (2026-07-17) was a single-use explicit
  authorization for that order only; no further push is authorized by it. Push to
  `origin`/`staging` remains not authorized in this chain. **Production Supabase
  `bhgifjrfagkzubpyqpew`:** never accessed.
- **`supabase/.temp/`:** local Supabase CLI cache, **gitignored** since commit
  `be6f081` (was leaking the project ref + pooler URL).

## Closed phases

Full closeout narratives are archived, verbatim, in
`docs/closeouts/PROJECT_STATE_ARCHIVE_2026-07.md` (compaction A + B batches, same
order as below) and in `docs/ledgers/G28_LEDGER.md`. Commit SHAs are the accepted
technical commits; documentation-only phases show `(docs)`. Consult HEAD with
`git rev-parse HEAD`.

## Relevant standing debts (Documents front)

- Migrations 49 and 50 — applied and verified in staging; not applied in production
  by this chain.
- Later UI/runtime evolutions, the destination of the legacy RPC and any linking/
  revocation require a new architectural decision.
- Push — not authorized in this chain.
